"""Bundled-path linter for the plugin marketplace.

Stdlib only, no dependencies, runs from the repository root:

    python scripts/lint_bundled_paths.py

A plugin body that tells the agent to read `plugins/<name>/skills/x/references/y.md`
is describing a path that exists only in a checkout of THIS repository. Claude Code
installs plugins into its own cache directory, so at runtime that path resolves to
nothing and the reference silently does not load. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is the
substitution that survives installation, and it expands inside agent, command and
skill bodies, not only in hooks and MCP configs.

Three passes, each independently reported. Exits non-zero if any fails.

  1. self refs     a plugin referencing its OWN bundled file must go through
                   ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/... (or a skill-relative references/...
                   path from inside that same skill), never plugins/<self>/...
  2. cross refs    a plugin must not reach into ANOTHER plugin's files by path at
                   all. ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} points at the referencing plugin, so
                   it cannot express this, and the target may not even be
                   installed. Load the other plugin's skill by name instead.
  3. shipped refs  a ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/<path> reference only survives
                   installation if the compiler ships <path>. It ships roles,
                   workflows, contracts, policies and every file under
                   skills/<name>/; a references/, scripts/ or mcp/ directory at
                   the kernel root is copied nowhere, so the read fails on every
                   host and nothing else notices. Each reference is
                   resolved against the generated Claude package under
                   exports/claude/plugins/<name>/, which is the layout the
                   placeholder maps onto itself in; the other hosts are
                   rendered from the same kernel by the same rules and the drift
                   gate keeps them in step. Its motivating case: ai-tooling's
                   reasoning-patterns reference sat unshipped for eleven days
                   after the kernel neutralization, read by an agent and a
                   command on every host, and passed every other check.

What is deliberately NOT flagged:

  - attribution and provenance comments naming an upstream file
  - marketplace.json manifest paths (`./agents/x.md`), which are relative to the
    plugin source and are how the registry is written
  - `marketplace-ops`, whose subject matter IS this repository's layout, and
    `.claude/`, `docs/`, `evals/` and `exports/`, which are not shipped plugin
    bodies
  - prose that names a directory shape without instructing a read

GRANDFATHERED holds references that predate this linter. Each entry is real debt,
not a heuristic misread: fix the reference and delete the entry rather than adding
to the list. New violations must fail. UNSHIPPED is the same kind of baseline for
the third pass, and it is empty too: the 23 references its first run found were
fixed by moving the files under their plugins' skills. Move the file under a
skill, fix the reference, never add an entry.
