"""Fact-anchor linter for the plugin marketplace.

Stdlib only, no dependencies, runs from the repository root:

    python scripts/lint_fact_anchors.py            # check
    python scripts/lint_fact_anchors.py --report   # print every anchored value found

A knowledge plugin states the same load-bearing fact in several places on purpose.
The `ibkr` skill is the worked example: its execution-correction rule appears in five
files, its trigger-method guidance in four, and every fact worth knowing is echoed
from a reference into the agent's digest and again into an audit checklist. That
redundancy is deliberate. Each artifact is loaded on its own, so an agent reading
only the digest must still get the right number.

The cost is that a correction has to land in every copy at once. On 2026-08-13 a
single research pass corrected ten such facts across ten releases, by hand, and the
Web API rate limit had already been wrong in one file for months: a per-endpoint
number (10 req/s) stated as the global one (50 req/s per authenticated username).
Nothing mechanical would have caught it, because every copy was internally
plausible and no two were compared.

This linter compares them. Each anchor names a fact, the file that owns it, and a
regex whose first group captures the value. Every file in the repository is scanned
for that regex; if two files report different values, the anchor fails and both are
named. It is deliberately narrow: it only fires when two places disagree about the
same measured thing, which is exactly the drift a reviewer cannot see and a reader
cannot detect.

Three failure modes are reported:

  1. conflicts     two or more files state different values for one anchor. This is
                   the drift the linter exists for.
  2. orphans       the owning file no longer states its own fact, so the anchor is
                   watching something that moved. Re-point the anchor or restore the
                   statement; do not delete the anchor to make the build pass.
  3. unanchored    (report mode only) not a failure. Lists anchors found in exactly
                   one file, i.e. facts with no echo to drift against yet.

Adding an anchor is cheap and is the right response to correcting a fact twice.
Pick a phrasing stable enough to survive an edit, capture the value in group 1, and
prefer a number or a short verbatim quote over a sentence.

# Directories that are not shipped content and may legitimately restate a fact in
# a historical context (a changelog entry describes what a release said at the
# time, and must not be rewritten when the fact is later corrected).
#
# `docs/superpowers/` is deliberately absent from this tuple: two design documents
# under it currently state anchored facts, and whether they belong in the scan was
# analysed and left open rather than decided, because widening this list on a
# hypothesis is how coverage dies quietly. The changelog argument above cuts both
# ways here: a dated plan is a historical record the same way a changelog entry
# is, so rewriting it to keep a build green falsifies history, but unlike a
# changelog it does not announce itself as historical to a reader who does not
# already know the convention. Revisit only when a real conflict names a
# `docs/superpowers/` file as one of the two disagreeing copies, not on a hunch.
#
# `.peer-review` is excluded for the changelog reason at its strongest. A run
# directory holds an external model's words quoted verbatim, and the protocol that
# writes it forbids editing them: a claim and its falsifier are byte-identical for
# the whole run, and a ledger is never hand-edited. So a transcript that happens to
# quote an anchored fact, or to propose a mutation of one, cannot be corrected to
# keep this check green without destroying the evidence. It is also git-ignored, so
# it exists in one working tree and never in CI or another clone, which means a
# conflict it raises is invisible to everyone but the person who ran the review.
# Found on 2026-09-07, when a peer review of the constraint-saturation threshold
# quoted a proposed mutation of the verifier trigger, with a different lower bound
# than the shipped one, and failed this linter locally while CI stayed green.
