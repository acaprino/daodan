"""Host-vocabulary linter for the neutral plugin kernels.

Stdlib only, no dependencies, runs from the repository root:

    python scripts/lint_host_vocabulary.py

Every kernel under plugins/ is compiled into three host packages, and the
compiler copies role and workflow bodies as they are. The moment a body names
one host's team API or dispatch primitive, that host's vocabulary has become
every host's contract: a worker on Codex told to "call TaskUpdate" has no such
tool, and the instruction is either refused or silently improvised. The rule
lives in the `downstream-exports` skill: never name a host tool, team API or
dispatch primitive in neutral content. The mechanism belongs in each host's
harness template, and a kernel expresses only the obligation (deliver your owned
files, report delivered or failed, hold the barrier).

What is flagged: the Claude Code Agent Teams and Agent-tool vocabulary listed in
TOKENS, anywhere in a shipped plugin body, fenced blocks included, because the
worker prompts that carry the damage live inside them.

What is deliberately NOT flagged:

  - `marketplace-ops` and `ai-tooling`'s `agent-sdk-builder` skill, whose
    subject matter IS the agent tooling (CLAUDE.md: never de-brand them)
  - `project-setup/examples/`, which ships example CLAUDE.md files about the
    Claude Code host by design
  - generic words such as "spawn", "dispatch", "worker" and "orchestrator",
    which name the obligation rather than a host's implementation of it

GRANDFATHERED holds the per-file occurrence count observed when this linter
landed (marketplace 26.1.0). Each entry is real debt, not a heuristic misread:
neutralize the file and delete its entry rather than raising a count. A count
that grows, and a file that is not listed, fail.
