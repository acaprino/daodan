# Example: Good CLAUDE.md File

This is an example of a well-structured `CLAUDE.md` file following best practices.

## Key Characteristics

- **Single entry point**: Structure and overview in one file, references existing docs for deep dives
- **Evergreen structure shape**: top-level layout + repeating patterns + role per category. File-by-file annotation is used here for *specific* reasons (see note below), not as the default
- **Grounded**: All claims verifiable in codebase
- **Proportional**: Length scales with project complexity (this example: ~140 lines)
- **Pointers not copies**: References files, doesn't duplicate code
- **Universal applicability**: Only always-relevant guidance

## A note on the file-by-file detail shown below

The structure block in the example annotates every file. **This is not the default.** The level of detail is justified here because:

- Sibling files have overlapping naming patterns that do not self-disambiguate (e.g., `ItemList.tsx`, `TaskCard.tsx`, `TaskForm.tsx` are three distinct components whose roles cannot be inferred from the name alone)
- Some files are key entry points with non-obvious behavior (e.g., `client.ts` carries auth interceptors; `useApi.ts` is the React Query wrapper consumers must follow)
- The project is small enough that the full enumeration fits in the evergreen budget without ballooning the file

In a project with self-explanatory names, no naming collisions among siblings, or a directory count that would make full enumeration churn-prone, the same shape would be documented **categorically only**: top-level dirs + the structural pattern + the role of each category, with no per-file annotation. Example of the categorical-only style for the same project:

```
src/
  components/       # React UI components (functional + hooks). Naming: <Domain><Role>.tsx
  hooks/            # Custom React hooks (ALWAYS follow patterns here)
  store/            # Zustand state slices, one file per slice
  api/              # API client (axios) + endpoint definitions
  utils/            # Pure helpers, no React dependencies
```

The principle is **evergreen shape, not exhaustive enumeration**. File-by-file annotation belongs where name alone is ambiguous, where the file is a key entry point with non-obvious behavior, or to disambiguate siblings: never as the default for every project.

# Project Context

This is a React 18 + TypeScript web application for task management.

**Tech Stack:**
- React 18.2 with functional components + hooks (see `package.json:12-13`)
- TypeScript 5.3 (see `tsconfig.json`)
- Vite 5.x for build tooling (see `vite.config.ts`)
- Zustand for state management (see `src/store/`)
- React Query for data fetching (see `src/hooks/useApi.ts`)
- Tailwind CSS for styling (see `tailwind.config.js`)
- Caching: verify the configured backend before documenting it

## Project Structure

```

## Development Workflow

**Start dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
npm test              # Unit tests with Vitest
npm run test:e2e      # E2E tests with Playwright
```

**Linting/Formatting:**
We use Biome for linting and formatting (see `biome.json`).
DO NOT suggest code style changes: Biome handles this automatically.

**Before committing:**
Pre-commit hooks run Biome and type checking automatically.

## Important Patterns

**Custom Hooks:**
- ALWAYS follow patterns in `src/hooks/` directory
- Use React Query for all data fetching
- Example: `useApi.ts`, `useAuth.ts`

**State Management:**
- Use Zustand slices (see `src/store/`)
- Keep state minimal and derived
- Example: `src/store/tasks.ts`

**Component Patterns:**
- Functional components only
- Props interface in same file
- Extract complex logic to custom hooks

**API Conventions:**
- All API calls through React Query hooks
- Error handling via error boundaries
- Loading states via query.isLoading

## Testing

**Unit tests:** Vitest for components and utilities
**E2E tests:** Playwright for user flows
**Coverage:** Target 80%+ (run `npm run coverage`)

See `docs/testing-guide.md` for detailed testing patterns.

## Deployment

CI/CD via GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/`)
Deploys to Vercel automatically on merge to main.

See `docs/deployment.md` for environment variables and configuration.

## Common Tasks

**Add new feature:**
1. Create component in `src/components/`
2. Add state slice in `src/store/` if needed
3. Add API hook in `src/hooks/` if data fetching required
4. Add tests
5. Update types in `src/types/`

**Add new API endpoint:**
1. Add to `src/api/endpoints.ts`
2. Create React Query hook in `src/hooks/`
3. Add TypeScript types
4. Add tests

## Test-Suite Rules

Test ownership: source at unit; behavior at integration, contract and e2e.

1. Search before writing: find the existing owner for the intended layer and behavioral scope, and extend it. A parallel file for the same owner requires a justified scope split.
2. Unit tests mirror source ownership (for example `src/foo/bar.py` maps to `tests/unit/foo/test_bar.py`), following this project's convention. Integration, contract and e2e tests belong to a flow, endpoint or contract and may span several source modules.
3. Keep test layers explicit (unit, integration, e2e), each in its own directory with a runtime budget. A new test goes in the lowest layer that can express the behavior.
4. Test behavior through public interfaces, never implementation details. A refactor that preserves behavior must not break tests.
5. Never mark a test skipped (`.skip`, `xfail`, `@Disabled`, or equivalent) to make CI pass. Fix it, or quarantine it with a tracked reason.
6. Never weaken an assertion to make a failing test pass. A failing assertion is a signal about the code, not an obstacle in the test.
7. Retire tests only with retired behavior, in the same commit. Refactors, renames and migrations preserve and retarget meaningful protection.

## Working Principles

### 1. Think Before Coding
State assumptions explicitly. Ask when uncertain.
Present tradeoffs; don't pick silently.
- Read related code before editing; understand the call sites
- Isolate the root cause; don't patch symptoms
- Surface unknowns instead of guessing

### 2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem.
No speculative features or abstractions.
- One responsibility per function or module
- Delete code when it stops paying rent
- Prefer composition over premature inheritance

### 3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what the task requires.
Match existing style. Clean up only your own orphans.
- No drive-by refactors outside the task scope
- Preserve public APIs unless the task requires a change
- Keep diffs small and reviewable

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria, then loop until verified.
Transform "do X" into "X passes test Y".
- Write tests against behavior, not internals (evergreen tests)
- Verify with real evidence: run the code, read the output
- Stop when the criteria are met; don't gold-plate

### 5. Centralize Shared Logic
Give each shared concept an explicit owner within its domain. Before adding an external call or cross-cutting concern, find and extend the existing client or method when it represents the same concept. Keep unrelated domains separate; similar syntax alone does not justify a common abstraction.

## Key Principles

- **TypeScript strict mode enabled**: Fix type errors, don't use `any`
- **Accessibility matters**: Use semantic HTML, ARIA when needed
- **Performance conscious**: Lazy load routes, memoize expensive ops
- **Error boundaries**: Wrap risky components
- **Loading states**: Show feedback for async operations

## Why This Works

### ✅ Best Practices Applied

1. **Detailed Structure as Single Entry Point**
   - File-by-file mapping lets Claude navigate directly to relevant code
   - References existing docs/ for deep dives on complex topics
   - Length (~120 lines) is proportional to project complexity, not artificially capped

2. **Grounded in Reality**
   - "React 18.2" → verifiable in package.json:12-13
   - "Vite 5.x" → verifiable in vite.config.ts
   - "Zustand" → verifiable in src/store/
   - File paths reference actual locations

3. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - "See `docs/architecture.md`" instead of embedding architecture
   - "See `docs/testing-guide.md`" instead of full testing docs
   - References actual files: `src/hooks/useApi.ts`

4. **Pointers Not Copies**
   - "ALWAYS follow patterns in `src/hooks/`" → points to code
   - "Use patterns in `src/store/tasks.ts`" → example reference
   - Doesn't duplicate code snippets that will go stale

5. **Delegates to Tools**
   - "DO NOT suggest code style changes: Biome handles this"
   - Doesn't embed linting rules in CLAUDE.md
   - Lets pre-commit hooks enforce standards

6. **Universal Applicability**
   - Custom hooks pattern: always relevant
   - API conventions: always relevant
   - Component patterns: always relevant
   - Doesn't include task-specific details

7. **WHAT/WHY/HOW Structure**
   - WHAT: Tech stack, structure
   - WHY: Project purpose (task management app)
   - HOW: Development workflow, testing, deployment

### ❌ Anti-Patterns Avoided

- No code duplication from README
- No embedded type definitions
- No detailed formatting rules (delegates to Biome)
- No vague guidance ("write clean code")
- No invented features
- No outdated dependencies
- No over-instruction

### 📊 Metrics

- **Lines:** ~140 (proportional to project complexity: no hard cap) ✅
- **Structure detail:** Every significant file/directory mapped with purpose ✅
- **File references:** All verified to exist ✅
- **Commands:** All verified in package.json ✅
- **Single entry point:** References existing docs for depth ✅
- **Code duplication:** None ✅

## Contrast: Bad CLAUDE.md Example

Here's what NOT to do:

```markdown
# Bad Example (450 lines)

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons required
- Max line length 80
- [... 100 more lines of style rules that Biome should handle ...]

## Component Template

```tsx
// Copy this template for every component
import React from 'react';

interface Props {
  // ...
}

export const Component: React.FC<Props> = ({ ... }) => {
  return <div>...</div>;
};
```
[PROBLEM: Code will go stale, use file reference instead]

## API Endpoints

POST /api/users
GET /api/users/:id
PUT /api/users/:id
DELETE /api/users/:id
[... 50 more lines duplicating what's in OpenAPI spec ...]

## File Structure

src/utils/helpers.ts contains utility functions
[PROBLEM: File was moved to src/lib/helpers.ts months ago]

## Testing

We plan to use Jest for testing
[PROBLEM: No approved intention is attributed, and the reader cannot distinguish planned tooling from the runner actually configured]
```

**Problems:**
- Detailed catalogs obscure the instructions and their authoritative owners
- Style rules duplicate Biome config
- Code templates that go stale
- Duplicates OpenAPI spec
- Obsolete file reference (utils → lib)
- Presents planned tooling without attribution or an implementation status
- Competing directives have no clear scope or owner

## Verification Checklist

Before accepting a CLAUDE.md, verify:

- [ ] Length proportional to project complexity (no padding or duplication)
- [ ] Project structure documents the evergreen shape (top-level layout + structural patterns + role per category); file-by-file annotation only where names alone are ambiguous, where the file is a key entry point, or to disambiguate siblings: no exhaustive trees
- [ ] All file paths exist
- [ ] Commands match their configured sources; permitted execution and unperformed checks are distinguished
- [ ] All dependencies are accurate
- [ ] No code duplication
- [ ] No style policing
- [ ] Uses progressive disclosure
- [ ] References actual files
- [ ] No invented features
- [ ] Delegates formatting to tools
- [ ] Unverifiable claims retain their unknown status; removal requires evidence or an authorized migration that preserves the information
- [ ] Parenthetical asides use sentences or parentheses rather than clauses bracketed by dashes
