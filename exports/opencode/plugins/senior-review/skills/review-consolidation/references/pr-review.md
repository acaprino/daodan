<daodan_host_binding host="opencode">
This binding governs execution of this package and its loaded references. It takes
precedence over executable examples written for another host. Use only registered
tools and their actual input schema; an example never creates a tool, argument,
permission, model alias or nested worker capability. Preserve the generated worker
allowlist, dependency closure, scope and delivery contracts.

OpenCode V2 binding: repository reads use read/glob/grep, writes use write/edit/patch,
shell execution uses shell, network tools are webfetch/websearch, and clarification
uses the registered question tool. shell takes command, optional workdir, timeout
in milliseconds and background. It does not provide interactive stdin. Persistent
capture uses background: true and an explicit noninteractive stop signal.
Load skills with skill using id: "<plugin>:<skill>". Dispatch registered roles with
subagent using agent: "<owner>:<role>", description and prompt; optional sessionID
continues that child, and background: true requests asynchronous completion.
Use only roles allowed by the current harness and permissions. A child cannot
dispatch nested workers when its permissions or the configured depth deny it.
Workflow entries are /<plugin>:<workflow>, registered by the package loader.
Inherit the session model; an override requires its authorized, actually available
provider/model identity, not another host's short model alias.
The loader includes required local providers and registers plugin-declared MCP
servers. Qualified foreign providers need a compatible V2 plugin/skill provisioned
through this host, never a Claude marketplace command. Check the active registry:
registration metadata alone does not prove a connected server or usable tool.
Inherit the active session's model and default variant. A source model alias such
as sonnet is not a portable override; request a different model only through an
explicit adapter mapping to a valid host identity and user authorization.

The executing agent and its coordinator own continuation, recovery, verification
and delivery. Skills supply knowledge and method instructions; they are not
executors or a runtime persistence mechanism.

Resolve each component by kind and exact installed identity. A role is dispatched
as a worker, a skill loads instructions, and a workflow starts its declared method.
Kernel owner-qualified skill references are logical provider identities: resolve
them to the actual host registry name and verified installed provider path. Do not
invent a registry string by adding an owner's prefix when the host does not use it.
Do not load an agent identity as a skill or execute a workflow name as a shell
command. Named foreign providers remain mandatory. If an installed provider, MCP
server or required isolation mechanism is unavailable, stop its dependent phase
and report the missing capability. Do not install a different host's plugin or
substitute unrelated skills to claim coverage.

Shell execution alone does not establish interactive stdin. Before a capture or
checkpoint, use an available session-control mechanism. When stdin is unavailable,
keep user-driven capture in a supported background process with bounded output and
an explicit stop signal controlled by the coordinator after the user's completion
message. Close owned browser/process resources on completion or cancellation.

Continue working within the current authorization while the requested result is
achievable. After a tool error, inspect its cause, correct the relevant input or
implementation, retry when justified and verify the outcome; never repeat a
failing action blindly. Do not close the turn with a promise or a partial result
when an authorized next step can still produce or verify the requested result.
Stop only for a documented real impediment, a missing required capability, an
unresolved human decision or the caller's stop request. At that boundary, report
completed results, remaining work and the concrete prerequisite for continuation;
continue any independent work that the blocker does not prevent.

A tool's successful exit, a worker stop or an idle session is not the deliverable.
Return final text naming observed findings, artifact paths, executed checks and
blockers. An empty worker result is missing delivery: inspect or resume that worker
when permitted, or record failure. Verify required artifacts and candidate gates
before marking the requested outcome complete.

This is an execution binding, not a rewrite of source examples. Preserve programming
language fences, domain code and host APIs that are the subject of marketplace-ops
or agent-sdk-builder. A host-as-subject API is not a tool provided to this session.
Compiled binding and static checks do not prove an installed host executed a run.

## Phase 3: Generate PR Description

Using the analysis from Phase 1 and all accounted reviewer findings from Phase 2,
including selected stack specialists, generate a complete PR description after
the canonical evidence/provenance verification. Include selected dimensions,
code-based skips and missing evidence so the description states its coverage.

### PR Description Template

```markdown
## Summary

[2-3 sentence executive summary of what this PR does and why]

**Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High/Critical] | **Review Time**: ~[estimate] min | **Lines**: +[X] / -[Y]

## What Changed

### [Category Icon] [Category] Changes
- [status]: `filename` -- [brief description of change]

[Repeat for each category with changes]

## Why These Changes

[Extract motivation from commit messages and code context -- the business reason]

## Type of Change

- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] Refactoring
- [ ] Dependency update
- [ ] Configuration change
- [ ] Documentation

## How to Test

1. [Step-by-step testing instructions]
2. [Include specific commands to run]
3. [Expected outcomes]

## Risk Assessment

| Factor | Level | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Size | [Low/Med/High] | [X files, Y lines] |
| Complexity | [Low/Med/High] | [description] |
| Test Coverage | [Low/Med/High] | [description] |
| Dependencies | [Low/Med/High] | [description] |
| Security | [Low/Med/High] | [description] |

[Include any security findings from Agent B]

[Include verified stack-specialist findings and their relevant risk factors]

## Review Coverage

[Selected dimensions, code-based skips, failed deliveries and unavailable evidence]

## Hygiene

[Include the hygiene findings from Agent A, or "Clean". One row per finding
with the path, what it is, and the cleanup phase that resolves it. Omit this
section entirely when the diff is clean, rather than leaving an empty heading.]

## Breaking Changes

[List any breaking changes, or "None"]

## Review Checklist

### General
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] No debugging code left
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed

### Code Quality
[Context-aware items based on file types changed]

### Testing
[Items based on whether tests were added/modified]

### Security
[Items based on security agent findings]
```

### PR Split Suggestions (if applicable)

If `--split-check` flag is set or PR exceeds 500 lines, include:

```markdown
## PR Split Suggestion

This PR is [X] lines across [Y] files. Consider splitting into:

1. **[logical unit 1]**: [files], [purpose]
2. **[logical unit 2]**: [files], [purpose]

This improves review quality and reduces merge conflict risk.
```

## Phase 4: Present & Optionally Create PR

### Always: Present the description

Show the complete PR description in the conversation and ask:

```
PR description generated.

Risk Level: [level]
Files: [count] | Lines: +[X]/-[Y]

1. Create PR now (pushes branch and creates PR via gh)
2. Copy description only (I'll create the PR manually)
3. Revise -- adjust the description first
```

### If `--create` flag or user chooses option 1:

First check if branch is pushed:
```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u} 2>/dev/null
```

If not pushed, ask:
```
Branch [name] hasn't been pushed to remote. Push and create PR?
```

Then create the PR:
```bash
git push -u origin [branch-name]
gh pr create --base [base-branch] --title "[title]" --body "[description]"
```

Present the PR URL when done.

### CLAUDE.md Alignment Check

After generating the PR description, check if changes suggest the project's `CLAUDE.md` needs updating:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (if it exists)
2. Cross-reference changed files with documented conventions, structure, and workflows
3. If `CLAUDE.md` references outdated information, add a note in the PR description under a `## CLAUDE.md Updates Needed` section

---

### If `--strict-mode` and Critical risk:

```
STRICT MODE: Critical risk factors detected. Recommend splitting or addressing security findings before creating PR.
```
