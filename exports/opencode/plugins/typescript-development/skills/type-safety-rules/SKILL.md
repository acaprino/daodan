<daodan_host_binding host="opencode">
This binding governs execution of this package and its loaded references. It takes
precedence over executable examples written for another host. Use only registered
tools and their actual input schema; an example never creates a tool, argument,
permission, model alias or nested worker capability. Preserve the generated worker
allowlist, dependency closure, scope and delivery contracts.

OpenCode V2 binding: repository reads use read/glob/grep, writes use write/edit/patch,
shell execution uses shell, network tools are webfetch/websearch, and clarification
uses the registered question tool. shell takes command, optional workdir, timeout
in milliseconds and background. It does not provide interactive stdin. Persistent
capture uses background: true and an explicit noninteractive stop signal.
Load skills with skill using id: "<plugin>:<skill>". Dispatch registered roles with
subagent using agent: "<owner>:<role>", description and prompt; optional sessionID
continues that child, and background: true requests asynchronous completion.
Use only roles allowed by the current harness and permissions. A child cannot
dispatch nested workers when its permissions or the configured depth deny it.
Workflow entries are /<plugin>:<workflow>, registered by the package loader.
Inherit the session model; an override requires its authorized, actually available
provider/model identity, not another host's short model alias.
The loader includes required local providers and registers plugin-declared MCP
servers. Qualified foreign providers need a compatible V2 plugin/skill provisioned
through this host, never a Claude marketplace command. Check the active registry:
registration metadata alone does not prove a connected server or usable tool.
Inherit the active session's model and default variant. A source model alias such
as sonnet is not a portable override; request a different model only through an
explicit adapter mapping to a valid host identity and user authorization.

The executing agent and its coordinator own continuation, recovery, verification
and delivery. Skills supply knowledge and method instructions; they are not
executors or a runtime persistence mechanism.

Resolve each component by kind and exact installed identity. A role is dispatched
as a worker, a skill loads instructions, and a workflow starts its declared method.
Kernel owner-qualified skill references are logical provider identities: resolve
them to the actual host registry name and verified installed provider path. Do not
invent a registry string by adding an owner's prefix when the host does not use it.
Do not load an agent identity as a skill or execute a workflow name as a shell
command. Declared required foreign providers remain mandatory. If a required
provider or capability (including required MCP access or isolation) is unavailable,
stop its dependent phase and report the missing capability. Optional external
providers follow the method's declared selection and absence behavior; their
absence alone does not block the base workflow. Report any explicitly requested
but unavailable provider contribution as unfulfilled and continue independent
work. Do not install a different host's plugin or
substitute unrelated skills to claim coverage.

Shell execution alone does not establish interactive stdin. Before a capture or
checkpoint, use an available session-control mechanism. When stdin is unavailable,
keep user-driven capture in a supported background process with bounded output and
an explicit stop signal controlled by the coordinator after the user's completion
message. Close owned browser/process resources on completion or cancellation.

Continue working within the current authorization while the requested result is
achievable. After a tool error, inspect its cause, correct the relevant input or
implementation, retry when justified and verify the outcome; never repeat a
failing action blindly. Do not close the turn with a promise or a partial result
when an authorized next step can still produce or verify the requested result.
Stop only for a documented real impediment, a missing required capability, an
unresolved human decision or the caller's stop request. At that boundary, report
completed results, remaining work and the concrete prerequisite for continuation;
continue any independent work that the blocker does not prevent.

A tool's successful exit, a worker stop or an idle session is not the deliverable.
Return final text naming observed findings, artifact paths, executed checks and
blockers. An empty worker result is missing delivery: inspect or resume that worker
when permitted, or record failure. Verify required artifacts and candidate gates
before marking the requested outcome complete.

This is an execution binding, not a rewrite of source examples. Preserve programming
language fences, domain code and host APIs that are the subject of marketplace-ops
or agent-sdk-builder. A host-as-subject API is not a tool provided to this session.
Compiled binding and static checks do not prove an installed host executed a run.

# TypeScript Type-Safety Rules

Review-oriented rule set for hunting type-system erosion in TypeScript codebases. 20 rules across 7 categories, prioritized by blast radius. Used as the audit checklist by the `type-safety-auditor` agent and usable standalone while writing or hardening TypeScript.

## Review evidence

Rule examples, grep hits and priority labels nominate candidates. Promote only a reachable type/runtime mismatch or a violated explicit project contract, after checking equivalent guards and effective inherited configuration. Missing preferred syntax, schema library or config flag alone is not a defect. Use impact-based severity and the caller’s report; no universal score. See [TypeScript configuration inheritance](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#extends).

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Any Erosion | CRITICAL | `any-` |
| 2 | Unsound Casts | CRITICAL | `cast-` |
| 3 | Boundary Validation | CRITICAL | `boundary-` |
| 4 | Assertion Abuse | HIGH | `assert-` |
| 5 | Compiler Configuration | HIGH | `config-` |
| 6 | Exhaustiveness | MEDIUM-HIGH | `exhaust-` |
| 7 | Generics Soundness | MEDIUM | `generics-` |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Any Erosion (CRITICAL)

- `any-explicit` - Replace explicit `any` with `unknown` plus narrowing
- `any-implicit-boundary` - Type the results of `JSON.parse`, `response.json()`, and `catch` immediately
- `any-generic-default` - Never default a type parameter to `any`

### 2. Unsound Casts (CRITICAL)

- `cast-as-unsound` - An `as` cast that changes the shape needs a runtime check instead
- `cast-double` - `as unknown as X` is a type-system bypass; write a guard or converter
- `cast-const-assertion` - Use `as const` for literal narrowing instead of widening annotations

### 3. Boundary Validation (CRITICAL)

- `boundary-http` - Parse HTTP payloads with a schema at the edge
- `boundary-queue` - Validate queue and event messages before processing
- `boundary-storage` - Validate and version storage reads (localStorage, files, DB JSON)
- `boundary-env` - Access environment variables through one validated config module

### 4. Assertion Abuse (HIGH)

- `assert-non-null` - `!` needs an adjacent invariant justification or a fail-fast check
- `assert-ts-expect-error` - Use `@ts-expect-error` with a reason, never `@ts-ignore`

### 5. Compiler Configuration (HIGH)

- `config-strict` - `"strict": true` is the baseline
- `config-unchecked-index` - Enable `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
- `config-exact-optional` - Enable `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
- `config-skiplibcheck` - `skipLibCheck` may speed up third-party types, never hide first-party errors

### 6. Exhaustiveness (MEDIUM-HIGH)

- `exhaust-switch-never` - Discriminated unions get a `never` assertion in the default branch
- `exhaust-satisfies-record` - Use `satisfies Record<K, V>` for complete lookup tables

### 7. Generics Soundness (MEDIUM)

- `generics-constraint` - Constrain type parameters on public APIs
- `generics-type-guards` - A type predicate must verify the whole shape it claims

## How to Use

Read individual rule files in the `rules/` directory for detailed explanations and code examples. Each rule file contains a brief explanation, an incorrect example, a correct example, and a detection hint for reviewers.

## Load map

| Read | When |
|------|------|
| `rules/<rule-id>.md` | Confirming or fixing one rule's violation |
| `references/audit.md` | Running the type-safety audit as a procedure (the TypeScript stack audit of `/daodan:check-health`): scope detection, tsc and ESLint ground truth, the isolated `type-safety-auditor` review and the scored report under the run directory |
