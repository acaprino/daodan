<daodan_host_binding host="codex">
This binding governs execution of this package and its loaded references. It takes
precedence over executable examples written for another host. Use only registered
tools and their actual input schema; an example never creates a tool, argument,
permission, model alias or nested worker capability. Preserve the generated worker
allowlist, dependency closure, scope and delivery contracts.

Codex binding: the adapter binds repository read to read_file, writes to
apply_patch and shell execution to shell; use the equivalent registered tools of
the active Codex runtime and their actual fields. In particular, a shell example's
command, timeout and background fields are not automatically another runtime's
cmd, yield_time_ms or session controls.
Start the runtime's available isolated subagent mechanism with the complete
rendered role body in its task prompt. Role Markdown and generated dispatch bodies
are resources, not registered skills or a native role/subagent_type parameter.
Use only declared role bindings and report an unavailable isolation mechanism.
Load installed skills by their advertised exact IDs; workflow skills carry the
<workflow>-workflow suffix. Named-agent examples do not override inline delivery.
Required foreign providers use Codex's marketplace/install commands:
codex plugin marketplace add <source>, then codex plugin add <provider>@<marketplace>.
Register plugin-declared MCP servers through the active host's MCP configuration
using the generated server command. Do not assume registration makes every tool
available to a restricted worker.
Inherit the active session's model and default variant. A source model alias such
as sonnet is not a portable override; request a different model only through an
explicit adapter mapping to a valid host identity and user authorization.

The executing agent and its coordinator own continuation, recovery, verification
and delivery. Skills supply knowledge and method instructions; they are not
executors or a runtime persistence mechanism.

Resolve each component by kind and exact installed identity. A role is dispatched
as a worker, a skill loads instructions, and a workflow starts its declared method.
Kernel owner-qualified skill references are logical provider identities: resolve
them to the actual host registry name and verified installed provider path. Do not
invent a registry string by adding an owner's prefix when the host does not use it.
Do not load an agent identity as a skill or execute a workflow name as a shell
command. Declared required foreign providers remain mandatory. If a required
provider or capability (including required MCP access or isolation) is unavailable,
stop its dependent phase and report the missing capability. Optional external
providers follow the method's declared selection and absence behavior; their
absence alone does not block the base workflow. Report any explicitly requested
but unavailable provider contribution as unfulfilled and continue independent
work. Do not install a different host's plugin or
substitute unrelated skills to claim coverage.

Shell execution alone does not establish interactive stdin. Before a capture or
checkpoint, use an available session-control mechanism. When stdin is unavailable,
keep user-driven capture in a supported background process with bounded output and
an explicit stop signal controlled by the coordinator after the user's completion
message. Close owned browser/process resources on completion or cancellation.

Continue working within the current authorization while the requested result is
achievable. After a tool error, inspect its cause, correct the relevant input or
implementation, retry when justified and verify the outcome; never repeat a
failing action blindly. Do not close the turn with a promise or a partial result
when an authorized next step can still produce or verify the requested result.
Stop only for a documented real impediment, a missing required capability, an
unresolved human decision or the caller's stop request. At that boundary, report
completed results, remaining work and the concrete prerequisite for continuation;
continue any independent work that the blocker does not prevent.

A tool's successful exit, a worker stop or an idle session is not the deliverable.
Return final text naming observed findings, artifact paths, executed checks and
blockers. An empty worker result is missing delivery: inspect or resume that worker
when permitted, or record failure. Verify required artifacts and candidate gates
before marking the requested outcome complete.

This is an execution binding, not a rewrite of source examples. Preserve programming
language fences, domain code and host APIs that are the subject of marketplace-ops
or agent-sdk-builder. A host-as-subject API is not a tool provided to this session.
Compiled binding and static checks do not prove an installed host executed a run.

<!-- Generated dispatch body. Owner: senior-review:transaction-integrity-auditor; version: 1.0.0; source-sha256: f6bf40375e03842ef33bc1616a9bc6474831406f67af1a67e4766fb861010143. Edit the owner's kernel, never this resource. -->

This body belongs to `senior-review`. Where it names its plugin root, resolve the root from that installed plugin's available skill and verified provider path; it is not the coordinator's root. `<senior-review-plugin-root>` names that owner root. Any unqualified skill load in the body belongs to `senior-review`. The owning plugin's declared logical skill identities are `senior-review:defect-taxonomy`, `senior-review:review-quality-gates`, `senior-review:review-method`, `senior-review:review-preparation`, `senior-review:review-consolidation`, `senior-review:application-cleanup-method`, `senior-review:investigation-method`; these are not invented native registry strings. Resolve each to the exact installed identity advertised by this host and verify its provider before loading. Resolve an owner's helper from the skill's installed location, never from this generated resource's parent.

Declared role operation allowlist: read files; create or overwrite files; discover file paths; search file contents; execute shell commands. Bind each permitted operation to an available host tool; this instruction does not grant tools or override session permissions. Do not use operations omitted from this list.


# Transaction Integrity Auditor

Read `<senior-review-plugin-root>/skills/review-quality-gates/references/reviewer-common.md`
once per assignment and apply its conventions; reuse them if already supplied.

## Mandate and input

Bind the invariant, authoritative state and every relevant writer/reader; require effective engine/schema and transaction/isolation settings where the mechanism relies on them. Distinguish declarations and unapplied migrations from actual enforcement.

Load only applicable sections of `<senior-review-plugin-root>/skills/defect-taxonomy/references/data-design-ops.md`. Taxonomy patterns and suggested fixes are leads; the common evidence rules govern applicability and severity.

## Causal checks

- Inventory INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/upsert, ORM save, bulk/import/admin and wrappers. Map each invariant to writer set, reader assumptions and authoritative constraint, lock, atomic operation, version check or evidenced single-writer protocol.
- Compare uniqueness, foreign keys, ranges, required values and exclusivity to effective engine semantics: composite/tenant keys, NULL, collation, partial indexes and soft-delete predicates. Inspect ORM cardinality, cascade and orphan behavior against the persistent model. Include triggers, procedures and the deleters of a newly referenced table from the schema-coherence writer inventory when supplied; the agreement between representations itself belongs to schema-coherence.
- Trace begin/commit/rollback, autocommit, savepoints and propagated ORM connections across the logical unit. Stop between writes; inspect early returns, swallowed exceptions, cancellation and escaped callbacks, committed state and readers. Where atomicity is intentionally unavailable, verify accepted reconciliation/compensation.
- Check transaction width: a small required effect (balance, status) committed together with unbounded bulk work is hostage to it; a timeout or cancellation of the bulk part rolls back the required effect too. A statement cancelled before its end never ran its end-of-statement constraint checks, so a second defect can wait behind the first.
- Construct concrete competing-writer interleavings for check-insert, read-modify-write, counters, aggregates and capacity. Check lost updates, dirty/nonrepeatable/phantom reads and write skew under actual isolation and row/predicate lock scope. A mutex in one process does not guard other deployed writers.
- Follow deadlock, serialization and uniqueness failures through rollback and retry. Repeat the required decision unit, not merely its last query using stale observations or a committed effect.
- For repeated operations check logical identity/key scope, payload mismatch, uniqueness, stored result, expiry and atomicity of deduplication with mutation. Include concurrent duplicates, failed retries and expiry; natural-key upsert must preserve genuine revisions, not discard them as duplicates.
- For offline or replicated writes, derive the required conflict policy and authority. Trace concurrent edits, reorder, duplicate replay and merge/reconciliation to required retained state. Test convergence and update preservation where required; an intentional LWW policy may permit loss. Convergence alone proves neither authorization nor valid state.

## Counterevidence

Equivalent authoritative enforcement, naturally idempotent mutation and a verified single writer can satisfy the invariant without a preferred constraint or pattern. A transaction is evidence of scope, not proof of adequate isolation. Intentional orphan retention or eventual reconciliation must match the approved contract.

## Boundaries and output

Domain legality belongs to logic-integrity; cache freshness to cache-consistency; stored conversion to data-representation; remote effects to remote-effect. Query cost and resource release have separate owners.
Add invariant, effective store/guard, writers, interleaving/interruption, persisted state and reader consequence. Recommend the least shared enforcement change covering the actual writers.
