# Working principles

Principles 1-4 derive from multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills (MIT), snapshot
2026-05-17. Their sub-bullets and principle 5 are local adaptations.

Use this block when creating instructions if the project has no equivalent
working guidance. Preserve equivalent project-specific guidance when maintaining
an existing file. Missing headings or different wording alone are not defects.

## Working Principles

### 1. Think Before Coding
State assumptions explicitly. Ask when uncertain.
Present tradeoffs; don't pick silently.
- Read related code before editing; understand the call sites
- Isolate the root cause; don't patch symptoms
- Surface unknowns instead of guessing

### 2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem.
No speculative features or abstractions.
- One responsibility per function or module
- Delete code when it stops paying rent
- Prefer composition over premature inheritance

### 3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what the task requires.
Match existing style. Clean up only your own orphans.
- No drive-by refactors outside the task scope
- Preserve public APIs unless the task requires a change
- Keep diffs small and reviewable

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria, then loop until verified.
Transform "do X" into "X passes test Y".
- Write tests against behavior, not internals (evergreen tests)
- Verify with real evidence: run the code, read the output
- Stop when the criteria are met; don't gold-plate

### 5. Centralize Shared Logic
Give each shared concept an explicit owner within its domain. Before adding an external call or cross-cutting concern, find and extend the existing client or method when it represents the same concept. Keep unrelated domains separate; similar syntax alone does not justify a common abstraction.
