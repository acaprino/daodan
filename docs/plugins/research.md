# Research Plugin

> Deep web research modelled on the commercial deep-research products (clarify, plan, parallel iterative researchers, citation check, report file), plus quick single-fact lookups. Web only: it reads no local codebase and depends on nothing.

## Command

### `/research:team-research`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Invoke** | `/research:team-research "<question>" [--depth auto\|quick\|standard\|deep] [--no-clarify] [--auto] [--out <file-or-dir>] [--backend auto\|websearch\|serper] [--domain <hint>]` |
| **Writes** | `research/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md` (or `--out`) and `<stem>.researchers.md` beside it |

Phases: pre-flight (backend detection), clarify (2-4 questions in one call, only when the question is ambiguous; `--no-clarify` skips), plan (sub-questions with source families and boundaries, shown for approval; `--auto` skips both gates), wave 1 (one `deep-researcher` per sub-question, parallel), gap analysis (verifiers on contradictions; at `deep` a targeted wave 2), synthesis (long-form report in prose), citation check (every claim resolves to a source a researcher read), deliver (file + companion + chat summary).

| Tier | Researchers | Pages read | Waves | Per-researcher budget |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `quick` | 1-2 | ~10 | 1 | 8 searches / 6 pages / 2 rounds |
| `standard` | 3-5 | 30-60 | 1 + verifiers | 15 / 12 / 4 |
| `deep` | 6-12 | 100+ | 2 + verifiers | 25 / 20 / 6 |

`auto` picks the tier from the question; a one-fact question is answered by `quick-searcher` directly with no run. Report sections: run header, executive summary, key findings, one section per sub-question, contradictions and resolutions, confidence and limitations, sources (only pages actually read), methodology (the approved plan verbatim, per-researcher budgets and exit reasons).

```
/research:team-research "Best practices for WebSocket reconnection in 2026"
/research:team-research "GDPR retention rules for transaction logs" --domain law --depth deep
/research:team-research "Should we migrate from REST to gRPC?" --auto --out docs/research/
```

## Using it

### A first run

```
/research:team-research "How do Rust, Go and Zig handle error propagation, and what do practitioners complain about in each?"
```

What you will see, in order:

1. **A clarification prompt, only if the question is ambiguous.** Up to four multiple-choice questions in one dialog (scope, audience, time window, jurisdiction, what a good answer looks like). A clear question skips this step and the lead says so in one line. Answer with the `Other` field when none of the choices fit.
2. **The research plan**, as a dialog with three options: `Approve` runs it; `Change depth` re-plans at another tier; `Edit the plan` takes free text (drop a sub-question, add one, narrow the time window), merges it, and shows the plan once more. The plan lists the restated question, the tier and why, the backend, the sub-questions with their source families and boundaries, the researcher count, estimated pages read and time, and the output path.
3. **The run.** Researchers spawn in one batch; at `deep` a second batch follows the gap analysis. Nothing is printed between the plan and the delivery beyond the spawn activity the session already shows. The plan's estimated time is the figure to go by.
4. **The delivery**: run header, executive summary, the two file paths and the run metadata (tier, researchers per wave, pages read, backend, wall time, failures and re-spawns). The full report is in the file.

### Choosing the depth

`--depth auto` (the default) reads the question: one well-defined question with a few authoritative answers gets `quick`, a comparison or a "how do people do X" gets `standard`, an open-ended or decision-grade question gets `deep`. Force a tier when you know better: `--depth quick` for a cheap first pass you may deepen later, `--depth deep` when the report is going to drive a decision and you want the second wave and 100+ pages read. A single-fact question ("what is the default port of PostgreSQL") is not a research run at all: the lead answers it through `quick-searcher` with one source and writes no file.

### Reading the output

- `research/<date>-<slug>.md` is the report. Start from the executive summary and key findings; every `[n]` resolves to the Sources section, which lists only pages a researcher actually read, each with the date the page carries and an authority rank from 1 (official documentation) to 5 (general blog). The confidence and limitations section says what rests on one source, what could not be verified, and which primary sources were paywalled or bot-blocked, by URL, so you can open them yourself.
- `research/<date>-<slug>.researchers.md` is the companion: every researcher and verifier report verbatim, in spawn order. Use it to audit a claim back to the researcher that found it, or to see what was searched and not found.
- The methodology appendix holds the approved plan verbatim and, per researcher, the exit reason (`saturated`, `budget-exhausted`, `target-not-found`, `error`) and the budget used. A report whose researchers mostly exited `budget-exhausted` is one worth re-running at the next tier.

### Unattended runs

`--auto` skips both gates: the plan is printed and the run starts. Combine it with `--out` to land the report where you want it:

```
/research:team-research "State of WebGPU support across browsers" --auto --depth standard --out docs/research/
```

`--out` takes a file path or a directory; a directory gets the default filename inside it. `--no-clarify` is the half-way option: no clarification questions, but the plan still waits for approval.

### Enabling the serper.dev backend (optional)

By default the plugin searches with the session's native `WebSearch`. Adding a serper.dev key switches discovery to Google's index and adds the `news` and `scholar` verticals, date filters and up to 100 results per call; the report header then says `Backend: serper`.

The short way: get a key at https://serper.dev (2,500 free queries, no card), then run

```
/research:team-research "<your question>" --backend serper
```

With no key set, that asks for one in chat: paste it into the free-text field and the run continues on serper. The key is saved to `~/.serper_key`, so every later run finds it and the question is asked once, not every time. The other two options in that dialog are to continue on native search for this run, or to cancel.

Two things worth knowing before you paste: a key typed in chat is in the session transcript, and the file is written readable only by your user (a real permission on POSIX; on Windows it inherits your profile's ACL). If you would rather the key never appear in a transcript, set it in the environment instead, which takes precedence over the file:

```
export SERPER_API_KEY=...          # bash, zsh; put it in your profile to persist
$env:SERPER_API_KEY = "..."        # PowerShell
```

Either way `--backend auto` (the default) uses serper whenever a key is available, `--backend websearch` forces the native tool even when one is, and `--backend serper` forces serper. To check what the plugin can see, or to save a key by hand:

```
python plugins/research/skills/web-search-techniques/scripts/websearch.py --check-key
printf '%s' YOUR_KEY | python plugins/research/skills/web-search-techniques/scripts/websearch.py --set-key
```

`--check-key` makes no network call and costs no credit. To revoke, delete `~/.serper_key` (and unset the environment variable). Unattended runs never ask: `--backend serper --auto` with no key stops with the setup line rather than waiting on a question nobody is there to answer.

Cost per run, order of magnitude: `standard` makes 45-75 serper calls, `deep` 150-300; a call returning more than 10 results costs two credits. The plan states the approximate count before you approve it. Serper never replaces reading: snippets qualify a page for fetching, and only pages actually read are cited.

### When it stops instead of running

| Message | Cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| "No search backend available" | `WebSearch` is not in the session's toolset and no serper key is set | Enable web search for the session, or set `SERPER_API_KEY` |
| The `websearch.py` setup line | `--backend serper --auto` with no key, or the service failed | Paste a key when asked (an attended run offers this), set one as above, or drop the flag to use native search |
| The lead says the question is about local code and stops | The question is about local code; the command researches the web only | Use Grep, Glob, or a codebase-oriented plugin |
| The lead lists which researchers failed and why, and stops | More than half the researchers of a wave failed (offline, blocked, quota) | Fix the connectivity and re-run; nothing is synthesized from a failed wave |

### Using the agents directly

`deep-researcher` can be invoked on its own for one focused investigation ("investigate X in depth across several sources, with citations"): it runs at the `standard` per-researcher budget and returns the same compressed report it would return to the lead. `quick-searcher` answers single facts with one source, and flags when a question actually needs a full run.

## Agents

### `deep-researcher`

Iterative investigator for one sub-question: orient with broad queries, read the pages that matter, keep a ledger (claims, sources with dates and authority rank, contradictions, open threads), narrow round by round, stop at saturation or budget, return a compressed cited report. Spawned by the command; directly invokable for one focused investigation.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `inherit` |
| **Tools** | Read, WebSearch, WebFetch, Bash |

### `quick-searcher`

Single-fact lookups (1-3 searches, lead with the answer) and the verifier the command spawns to settle one contested claim with a third independent source.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `sonnet` |
| **Tools** | Read, WebFetch, WebSearch, Bash |

## Skill

### `web-search-techniques`

Query formulation, source authority ranking, the two search backends, reading rules (WebFetch, then `webfetch.py` on a bot-block, browser only if `playwright-skill` happens to be installed), anti-loop rules. Loaded by both agents and the command.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `skills/web-search-techniques/scripts/websearch.py` | Optional serper.dev backend. Used when a key is available or `--backend serper`; `--vertical search\|news\|scholar`, `--num`, `--since h\|d\|w\|m\|y`, `--gl`, `--hl`, `--page`, `--timeout`, `--json`. `--check-key` reports availability without a network call; `--set-key` saves a key from stdin to `~/.serper_key`. Reads `SERPER_API_KEY` first, then that file. Exit 2 when no key is available, 1 on HTTP errors. Stdlib only |
| `skills/web-search-techniques/scripts/webfetch.py` | Bot-block fallback fetcher (Chrome TLS impersonation via curl_cffi, httpx fallback) |

Backend rule: `auto` uses serper when a key is available, native `WebSearch` otherwise; the choice is stated in the plan, in each researcher report and in the report header. Serper never replaces reading: snippets qualify a page for fetching, only read pages are cited.
