# Tauri Development Plugin

> Build fast, secure cross-platform apps. Expert Rust engineering plus Tauri 2 optimization for desktop and mobile, with concrete performance targets for startup time, memory, and IPC latency.

## Agents

### `tauri-desktop`

Expert in Tauri v2 + React desktop optimization for trading and high-frequency data scenarios, plus desktop-specific features.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `inherit` |
| **Use for** | IPC optimization, state management, memory leaks, WebView tuning, Raw Payloads with rkyv, Canvas/OffscreenCanvas HFT rendering, backpressure, window management, shell plugin, desktop bundling, platform WebViews |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the tauri-desktop agent to analyze [project/file]
```

**Performance targets:**
| Metric | Target | Critical |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Startup time | < 1s | < 2s |
| Memory baseline | < 100MB | < 150MB |
| IPC latency | < 0.5ms | < 1ms |
| Frame rate | 60 FPS | > 30 FPS |

### `tauri-mobile`

Expert in Tauri 2 mobile development for Android and iOS.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `inherit` |
| **Use for** | Mobile setup, emulator/ADB, mobile plugins (biometric, haptics, NFC), IAP, OAuth deep links, code signing, store deployment, mobile CI/CD |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the tauri-mobile agent to review [mobile project/feature]
```

### `rust-engineer`

Expert Rust developer specializing in systems programming and memory safety.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `inherit` |
| **Use for** | Ownership patterns, async tokio, FFI, performance optimization, tracing/observability, rkyv serialization, loom concurrency testing |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the rust-engineer agent to implement [feature]
```

**Checklist enforced:**
- Zero `unsafe` in the public API surface, encapsulated behind safe abstractions with documented invariants
- clippy::pedantic compliance
- Complete documentation with examples
- MIRI verification for unsafe blocks
