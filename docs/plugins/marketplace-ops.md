# Marketplace Ops Plugin

> Manage and maintain any Claude Code plugin marketplace with the standard `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + `plugins/<name>/` layout: audit marketplace integrity, scaffold new plugins, create skills and agents, and review content quality. Project conventions (author, license, categories, upstream sources) are read from the target marketplace, never hardcoded.

## Agents

### `marketplace-manager`

Expert marketplace operations manager for any Claude Code plugin marketplace.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | inherit |
| **Color** | yellow |
| **Tools** | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, WebFetch |
| **Use for** | Adding, auditing, reorganizing, versioning, or syncing plugins |

**Capabilities:**
- **Audit & Validation**: Cross-reference marketplace.json vs filesystem, validate frontmatter
- **Plugin Scaffolding**: Create new plugins with proper directory structure and registration
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning for plugins and marketplace
- **Upstream Sync**: Fetch and merge upstream changes while preserving local additions
- **AI Quality Review**: Score descriptions, prompts, and trigger accuracy (1-5 scale)
- **Consolidation Analysis**: Identify overlapping plugins and suggest reorganization

## Skills

### `marketplace-audit`

Structural validation of the marketplace ecosystem.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Invoke** | Skill reference; closest command is `/marketplace-ops:marketplace-health` for structural JSON validation |
| **Use for** | Pre-commit validation, detecting orphaned files, frontmatter checks, color harmony |

**Checks:**
- File existence vs marketplace.json references
- Orphaned files not registered in any plugin
- Frontmatter field validation (agents, skills, commands)
- Color consistency and harmony across plugins
- Naming conventions (kebab-case, filename/name match)
- Version sanity (valid semver)
- marketplace.json schema and duplicate keywords
- Dependency resolution and acyclicity, including the qualified `name@marketplace` form for cross-marketplace entries
- Documentation count drift: the docs index, README counts and every "N plugins" phrase

The audit script takes `--fix` and `--project-root`.

### `skills-creator`

Guided creation of new Claude Code plugin components.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Invoke** | Skill reference or "create a new skill/agent/plugin" |
| **Use for** | Creating skills, agents, commands, or full plugins with real content |

**Workflow:**
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Ask targeted questions about purpose, triggers, plugin placement
2. **Content Generation**: Write production-ready files (not placeholders)
3. **Marketplace Registration**: Update marketplace.json, bump versions
4. **Validation**: Verify paths, frontmatter, naming conventions

Includes a conventions reference with color palette, categories, agent structure patterns, and naming rules, a skills-versus-agents reference, and `scripts/validate_skills.py`, the engine behind `/marketplace-ops:skills-validate` (16 deterministic checks plus a per-component activation score).

## Commands

### `/marketplace-ops:marketplace-health`

Quick marketplace health check: validates marketplace.json, checks file references, and reports plugin counts and version status.

```
/marketplace-ops:marketplace-health [--fix] [--verbose]
```

`--fix` adds orphaned plugins to marketplace.json and removes missing references, each with confirmation, and bumps `metadata.version`. `--verbose` prints a per-plugin breakdown.

### `/marketplace-ops:marketplace-scaffold-plugin`

Scaffold a new plugin with proper directory structure, starter files, and marketplace.json registration.

```
/marketplace-ops:marketplace-scaffold-plugin my-plugin --with-agent --with-skill --with-command --category development --author "Name"
```

### `/marketplace-ops:marketplace-review`

AI-powered quality review of plugin descriptions, trigger keywords, agent prompts, skill instructions, and command definitions. Writes `.marketplace-review/REPORT.md`.

```
/marketplace-ops:marketplace-review [plugin-name] [--all] [--fix]
```

### `/marketplace-ops:skills-validate`

Deterministic activation-quality checks plus AI-powered body review for all skills and agents.

```
/marketplace-ops:skills-validate my-plugin
/marketplace-ops:skills-validate --all
/marketplace-ops:skills-validate my-plugin --skip-ai
```

**Deterministic checks (script):**
- Directive voice, TRIGGER WHEN / DO NOT TRIGGER WHEN clauses
- Passive pattern detection, description length (hard limit 1024 chars)
- Token budget (total description chars vs 15,000 char budget)
- SKILL.md body size (warn >300 lines, flag >500 lines)
- Agent body size (flag >800 lines)
- Em dash detection, example tags, context: fork, allowed-tools

**AI review dimensions (optional, skip with `--skip-ai`):**
- Structure, Clarity, Redundancy, Progressive disclosure, Tool restrictions, Isolation needs
- Each scored 1-5 with specific fix recommendations
