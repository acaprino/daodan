# TypeScript Development Plugin

> Build production TypeScript with a hands-on engineer agent plus deep standards and mastery skills, then review it with an adversarial type-safety auditor and a 20-rule review layer. Covers architecture + implementation, Knip dead code detection, Metabase coding patterns, and enterprise-grade TypeScript with type-safe patterns, modern tooling, and framework integration.

## Agents

### `typescript-engineer`

Hands-on TypeScript 5.x engineer. Designs architecture AND writes production code using modern tooling (pnpm/bun, Vite/tsup, Vitest, ESLint 9 flat config, Zod/Valibot). Type-safe, strict-mode, well-tested. Parallel to `python-engineer`.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `inherit` |
| **Use for** | Planning new TypeScript projects, designing architecture, making tech-stack decisions, implementing TS features, migrating JavaScript to TypeScript, setting up monorepos |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the typescript-engineer agent to [design/implement/migrate] [feature]
```

**Expertise:**
- Language: TS 5.10+ (const type parameters, `using` / `await using`, `satisfies`, template-literal types, discriminated unions, conditional/mapped types)
- Tooling: pnpm / bun, Vite / tsup / rollup, Vitest / Jest, ESLint 9 flat config, Biome, oxlint
- Web: Fastify / Hono / Nest 10+, React 19 SSR + RSC, tRPC for end-to-end type safety
- Data: Zod / Valibot runtime validation, Drizzle ORM / Prisma, SQLite / PostgreSQL, Redis
- Monorepo: Turborepo / Nx, pnpm workspaces, shared TS config via `tsconfig-base`
- Infra: Docker multi-stage (oven/bun or node:22-alpine), ESBuild-based production builds

**Conventions:** strict mode only (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`), no `any` without comment, runtime validation at boundaries, `satisfies` over annotation where inference wins, discriminated unions with exhaustive `switch` + `never` assertion, Result<T, E> pattern at module boundaries.

### `type-safety-auditor`

Adversarial TypeScript type-safety reviewer. Hunts type-system erosion: any leakage, unsound casts, missing runtime validation at boundaries, assertion abuse, tsconfig strictness drift, exhaustiveness gaps, and unsound generics or type guards. Spawned by `/senior-review:team-review` (dimension `ts-safety`) and `/senior-review:code-review` (Agent K) whenever the change touches `.ts`/`.tsx` files and the project has a `tsconfig.json`; senior-review hard-depends on this plugin.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `inherit` |
| **Use for** | Type-safety review of TypeScript changes or codebases, strict-mode compliance audits, pre-release soundness checks |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the type-safety-auditor agent to audit [path] for type-safety issues
```

## Skills

### `typescript-write`

Write TypeScript and JavaScript following Metabase coding standards and best practices.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Invoke** | Skill reference |
| **Use for** | TypeScript/JavaScript development, code refactoring, coding standards |

### `knip`

Find unused files, dependencies, exports, and types in JavaScript/TypeScript projects with Knip. Plugin system covers frameworks (React, Next.js, Vite), test runners (Vitest, Jest), and build tools.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Invoke** | Skill reference |
| **Use for** | Dead code detection, unused dependency cleanup, bundle size optimization, CI dependency hygiene |

### `mastering-typescript`

Master enterprise-grade TypeScript development with type-safe patterns, modern tooling, and framework integration. Upstream-synced from SpillwaveSolutions/mastering-typescript-skill.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Invoke** | Skill reference |
| **Use for** | TypeScript 5.9+ development, type system fundamentals (generics, mapped types, conditional types, satisfies operator), enterprise patterns (error handling, Zod validation), React integration, NestJS APIs, LangChain.js AI apps, JavaScript migration, modern toolchain configuration (Vite 7, pnpm, ESLint, Vitest) |

**Reference files:**
| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| type-system.md | Type system fundamentals, utility types, type guards |
| generics.md | Generic patterns, constraints, inference |
| enterprise-patterns.md | Error handling, validation, architecture patterns |
| react-integration.md | Type-safe React components, hooks, state management |
| nestjs-integration.md | NestJS scalable API patterns |
| toolchain.md | Vite 7, pnpm, ESLint, Vitest configuration |

### `type-safety-rules`

20 review-oriented type-safety rules across 7 categories (any erosion, unsound casts, boundary validation, assertion abuse, compiler configuration, exhaustiveness, generics soundness), one file per rule with incorrect/correct examples and detection hints. The audit checklist of `type-safety-auditor`; also usable standalone.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Invoke** | Skill reference |
| **Use for** | Type-safety review checklists, hardening existing TypeScript, rule-by-rule guidance |

## Commands

### `/typescript-development:review-typescript`

Type-safety review with deterministic ground truth: detects diff vs full scope, runs `tsc --noEmit` and ESLint when available, spawns `type-safety-auditor` with the 20-rule checklist, and writes an actionable report to `.ts-review/report.md`.

Arguments: `[src-path] [--full]`

**Related:** [senior-review](senior-review.md) (`/code-review --fix` delegates to Knip for TS/JS) | [react-development](react-development.md) (React-specific optimization)
