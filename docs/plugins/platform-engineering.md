# Platform Engineering Plugin

> Cross-platform development rulebook covering security, architecture, and performance for SPA, PWA, mobile (iOS/Android), and desktop (Electron/Tauri) applications. MUST/DO/DON'T framework with real-world incident references and platform-specific guidance.

## Agents

### `platform-reviewer`

Adversarial cross-platform code reviewer that audits code against the platform-engineering rulebook.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `inherit` |
| **Tools** | `Read, Write, Glob, Grep, Bash` |
| **Use for** | Reviewing PRs or code for security, architecture, or performance compliance across SPA, PWA, mobile, and desktop platforms |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the platform-reviewer agent to audit [path or PR]
```

**What it audits:**
- Server validation and trust boundaries
- Auth token storage (cookies vs localStorage vs secure storage)
- API security (CORS, rate limiting, HTTPS)
- XSS/CSP headers
- Secrets exposure
- Platform-specific security: Electron `nodeIntegration`, `contextIsolation`, `sandbox` and `webSecurity` settings, code signing, unvalidated `shell.openExternal()` URLs and broad IPC channels; Tauri command exposure; mobile certificate pinning, system biometrics and secrets in binaries; PWA sensitive data in the Cache API, broad service-worker scope and missing HTTPS
- Architecture patterns (client-server, REST vs GraphQL, offline-first)
- Performance (bundles, images, Core Web Vitals, SSR/SSG, CDN caching)

## Commands

### `/platform-engineering:platform-review`

Standalone cross-platform security, architecture, and performance review. Auto-detects the platform mix (SPA, PWA, mobile, Electron, Tauri) from `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `manifest.json`, and `tauri.conf.json`, then spawns the `platform-reviewer` agent against every applicable rulebook. Writes a persistent report to `.platform-review/REPORT.md`. Report-only; never auto-fixes.

```
/platform-engineering:platform-review                                # current directory, auto-detect platforms, all 3 dimensions
/platform-engineering:platform-review src/ --focus security          # security-only audit on a subdirectory
/platform-engineering:platform-review --platform tauri --focus arch  # Tauri architecture review
```

**Arguments:**
| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `[target-path]` | Path to review (default: current directory) |
| `--platform spa\|pwa\|mobile\|electron\|tauri\|auto` | Force a platform or let auto-detect handle it (default: `auto`) |
| `--focus security\|arch\|perf` | Restrict scope to one dimension (default: all three) |

**Output sections in `REPORT.md`:** detected platforms, summary counts, findings by severity (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM) with `file:line` plus rule violated and suggested fix, hardening checklist for Electron / Tauri, auth posture checklist, recommendations ordered by impact.

**When to invoke:**
- Before a PR touching auth, secrets, or platform integration
- Quarterly cross-platform hygiene
- After adding a new platform target (e.g., shipping mobile alongside web)
- Electron / Tauri release hardening
