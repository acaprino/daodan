# Stripe Plugin

> Integrate Stripe without reading 500 pages of docs. Covers payments, subscriptions, Connect marketplaces, billing, webhooks, and revenue optimization with ready-to-use patterns.

## Agents

### `stripe-integrator`

Complete Stripe API integrator covering payments, subscriptions, Connect marketplaces, billing, webhooks, and compliance.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `inherit` |
| **Use for** | Payment processing, subscriptions, marketplaces, billing, webhooks, SCA/3DS compliance, fraud prevention, dispute handling |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the stripe-integrator agent to [integrate/audit/extend] [Stripe feature]
```

**Core capabilities:**
- **Payments**: Payment intents, checkout sessions, payment links
- **Subscriptions**: Recurring billing, metered usage, tiered pricing
- **Connect**: Marketplace payments, platform fees, seller onboarding
- **Billing**: Invoices, customer portal, tax calculation
- **Webhooks**: Signature-verified event handling, subscription lifecycle, idempotency
- **Security**: 3D Secure, SCA compliance, fraud prevention (Radar)
- **Disputes**: Chargeback handling, evidence submission

**Quick reference:**
| Task | Method |
|------|--------|
| Create customer | `stripe.Customer.create()` |
| Checkout session | `stripe.checkout.Session.create()` |
| Subscription | `stripe.Subscription.create()` |
| Payment link | `stripe.PaymentLink.create()` |
| Report usage | `stripe.billing.MeterEvent.create()` (the legacy usage-record API was removed in `2025-03-31.basil`) |
| Connect account | `stripe.Account.create(type="express")` |

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
export STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
pip install stripe
```

### `revenue-optimizer`

Monetization expert. Analyzes your codebase to discover features, calculate service costs, model usage patterns, and create data-driven pricing strategies with revenue projections.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `inherit` |
| **Use for** | Feature cost analysis, pricing strategy, usage modeling, revenue projections, tier design |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the revenue-optimizer agent to [analyze/design/project] [pricing|tiers|revenue]
```

**5-Phase Workflow:**
1. **Discover**: Scan codebase for features, services, and integrations
2. **Cost Analysis**: Calculate per-user and per-feature costs
3. **Design**: Create pricing tiers based on value + cost data
4. **Implement**: Build payment integration and checkout flows
5. **Optimize**: Add conversion optimization and revenue tracking

**Key Metrics Calculated:**
| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| ARPU | (Free x $0 + Pro x $X + Biz x $Y) / Total Users |
| LTV | (ARPU x Margin) / Monthly Churn |
| Break-even | Fixed Costs / (ARPU - Variable Cost) |
| Optimal Price | (Cost Floor x 0.3) + (Value Ceiling x 0.7) |

### `stripe-webhooks-auditor`

Adversarial auditor for Stripe webhook integrations. Given a Stripe account plus a codebase, hunts for missing event coverage, signature verification pitfalls, missing idempotency, wrong runtime configuration, and stale endpoints. Report-only; never modifies code or Stripe state.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `inherit` |
| **Tools** | Read, Bash, Glob, Grep, WebFetch |
| **Use for** | Auditing an existing Stripe webhook setup, preparing for a production launch, after a webhook-related incident, or when adding Billing Meters / Entitlements and the event list needs to grow |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the stripe-webhooks-auditor agent to audit webhook setup
```
Also runnable as `/stripe:audit-webhooks` (see Commands below).

**Three surfaces to check:**
1. **Stripe account state**: configured endpoints, subscribed events, disabled endpoints, per-endpoint API version (via `webhook_audit.py`)
2. **Codebase implementation**: signature verification, raw body preservation, idempotency via `event.id`, runtime config, handler coverage
3. **Gap analysis**: required events per declared feature, against the events enabled on Stripe and the events the code actually handles

Pass criteria come from the canonical checklist in `skills/stripe/references/webhooks-production.md`.

**Inputs:**
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` or `STRIPE_RESTRICTED_KEY` (read-only scope is enough)
- Optional `--account <acct_id>` for Connect platforms
- Optional `--features <flags>` (e.g. `meters,entitlements,connect,trials`); inferred from codebase if omitted

## Skills

### `stripe`

Stripe knowledge base: API patterns, checkout optimization, subscription lifecycle, pricing strategies, webhook reliability, Firebase integration, cost analysis, revenue modeling. Loaded by `stripe-integrator` and `revenue-optimizer`; also usable standalone when you need patterns without agent invocation.

## Commands

### `/stripe:audit-webhooks`

Runs the `stripe-webhooks-auditor` agent against the current project. Enumerates Stripe-side state via `scripts/webhook_audit.py` (reads `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`), greps the codebase for webhook handlers, verifies each against the pass criteria in `webhooks-production.md`, and produces a prioritized remediation report. Report-only.

```
/stripe:audit-webhooks --features meters,entitlements,trials
/stripe:audit-webhooks --account acct_xxx
```

**When to invoke:**
- Before a production launch
- After adding Billing Meters or Entitlements (event list grows)
- Quarterly webhook hygiene
- During PR review of a webhook route
- After a webhook-related incident

**Prerequisites:** `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (or a read-only Restricted API Key) in env; Python with `stripe` installed.
