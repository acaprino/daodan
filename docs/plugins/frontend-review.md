# Frontend Review Plugin

> Full frontend review in one pass: an always-on design and UX audit driven by the four design skills from the three upstream plugins, paired with up to four auto-detected code dimensions (React performance, TypeScript type safety, PWA architecture, platform compliance). Produces one scored report per run and vendors no design content of its own.

## Prerequisites

Three upstream design plugins back the design and UX dimension. All three are hard, qualified dependencies with unconditional stop-and-install phrasing: Step 0 of the command loads all four skills before anything else runs, and the command stops without a partial design pass if any load fails.

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add pbakaus/impeccable
claude plugin install impeccable@impeccable
claude plugin marketplace add nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill
claude plugin install ui-ux-pro-max@ui-ux-pro-max-skill
claude plugin install frontend-design@claude-plugins-official
```

| Dependency | Provides | Referenced as |
|---|---|---|
| [pbakaus/impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable) (plugin 4.0.4, Apache-2.0) | `audit` mode (accessibility, performance, responsive checks) and `critique` mode (UX heuristic scoring): typography, color and contrast, spacing and layout, motion, cognitive load, platform conventions | `impeccable:impeccable` |
| [nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill](https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill) (plugin 2.11.0, MIT) | UI review against a style/palette/font-pairing library, plus design-token architecture and component state and variant coverage | `ui-ux-pro-max:ui-ux-pro-max`, `ui-ux-pro-max:design-system` |
| `frontend-design` (Anthropic, `claude-plugins-official` marketplace, Apache-2.0) | Visual craft evaluation criteria, applied to judge the existing UI, never to generate or redesign it | `frontend-design:frontend-design` |

`impeccable` also ships four support agents and a hooks file, and `ui-ux-pro-max` ships five more skills (`design`, `ui-styling`, `brand`, `banner-design`, `slides`); this plugin loads none of them.

The four code dimensions below are bare, local hard `dependencies` instead: `react-development`, `typescript-development`, `pwa-expert`, `platform-engineering`. The marketplace installs them with this plugin, so each is skipped only when the codebase shows no signal for it. The design dimension needs its own install-or-stop gate because its three plugins come from other marketplaces and the user installs them by hand.

## Commands

### `/frontend-review:review-frontend`

```
/frontend-review:review-frontend [path] [--full] [--strict-mode]
```

**Scope detection:**
- **Diff mode** (default): reviews only changed frontend files (`.tsx .jsx .ts .vue .svelte .css .scss`, plus `index.html` and manifest files) from `git diff`
- **Full mode**: scans the whole frontend surface (`src/ app/ components/ pages/ styles/`, or the given `path`) when no frontend changes exist in the diff, or `--full` is set. Discovery is capped at the first 120 files.
- A `path` argument roots the full-mode scan at that path, and in diff mode keeps only the changed files under it.

`--strict-mode` prints an explicit warning line if any Critical findings exist, on top of the normal report.

**Dimensions:**

| Dimension | Kind | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Design and UX | Always-on, inline | `impeccable`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `frontend-design` |
| React performance | Auto-detected | `react-development` plugin |
| TypeScript type safety | Auto-detected | `typescript-development` plugin |
| PWA architecture | Auto-detected | `pwa-expert` plugin |
| Platform compliance | Auto-detected | `platform-engineering` plugin |

Design and UX runs inline in the command's own context, against the four loaded skills; it is not a spawned agent, because the upstream plugins ship skills rather than reviewer agents. The four code dimensions spawn as parallel agents, one per matched signal. A code dimension is conditional only on its signal: its plugin is a hard dependency and is always installed.

**Activation, per code dimension:**

| Plugin | Backs | Agent spawned | Skipped: not matched |
|---|---|---|---|
| `react-development` | React performance | `react-development:react-performance-optimizer` | No `react` dependency in `package.json`, or no `.tsx`/`.jsx` files in scope |
| `typescript-development` | TypeScript type safety | `typescript-development:type-safety-auditor` | No `.tsx?` files in scope, or no `tsconfig.json` at the project root |
| `pwa-expert` | PWA architecture | `pwa-expert:pwa-architect` | No manifest, service worker, or Workbox config found |
| `platform-engineering` | Platform compliance | `platform-engineering:platform-reviewer` | Fewer than 2 of the fullstack/platform signals present |

There is one skip reason and it is always about the codebase: the dimension did not match. A missing plugin is not a reason, because all four are hard dependencies. A spawn failing with "Agent type not found" means a broken install, and the command stops and reports it rather than scoring a partial review.

**Deterministic ground truth (Step 3):** before any review runs, the command runs `eslint` over the scoped files (the changed files in diff mode, the files under `path` when one is given), and `tsc --noEmit` as well when the TypeScript signal matched. `tsc` checks the whole project under its own `tsconfig.json`, and only the diagnostics for scoped files are kept. Both outputs are fed to the design pass and to the matching code agent as ground truth. A missing tool never stops the command: the report records "eslint not configured" or "tsc not available" instead.

**Deduplication (Step 6):** when two dimensions flag the same file for the same underlying cause (design versus code, or code versus code: PWA and platform compliance both own the manifest, service worker and CSP; React performance and TypeScript type safety read the same components), the finding from the more specific dimension is kept, with one line noting which other dimension also caught it. A React re-render bug, for example, belongs to React performance, not to design and UX.

**Scoring model:**

Each dimension that ran reports its own `overall` score, 0 to 10. The report's overall score is a weighted mean over the dimensions that ran, not over all five:

- **Design and UX**: 40% of the weighted mean. It always contributes, since it is hard-gated: if it did not run, the command already stopped at Step 0.
- **Code dimensions**: the remaining 60%, split evenly across however many of the four actually ran. With `N` code dimensions run, each contributes `60/N` percentage points. With `N=0`, the overall score collapses to the design score alone.

A dimension skipped for lack of a signal is excluded from the mean entirely. It is never treated as a zero.

**Report:** `.frontend-review/report.md`, always at that path regardless of how many dimensions ran:

- Header with date and mode (diff or full), and file count
- Dimension status table (Run / Skipped: not matched, with the reason)
- Scores table per dimension plus the weighted overall
- Findings grouped Critical/High then Medium/Low, each with a `- [ ] Fixed` checkbox
- `## What's Working Well`
- `## Action Plan` with the top 5 fixes

A console summary prints alongside the file: overall score, per-dimension scores or skip status, severity counts, skipped dimensions with reasons, and the top 3 issues.

## Upstream pinning

Bindings verified against `impeccable` 4.0.4, `ui-ux-pro-max` 2.11.0, and the `frontend-design` skill on the official `claude-plugins-official` marketplace, as of 2026-08-05. A rename or skill move on any of the three breaks the Step 0 load, surfaced as "not installed" rather than as a clear upstream-drift error. Re-verify these three bindings on the `custom-plugin-refresh` cadence rather than waiting for a user report.
