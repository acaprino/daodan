# Kotlin Development Plugin

> Idiomatic Kotlin patterns: coroutines and structured concurrency, Flow / StateFlow / SharedFlow, Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) shared-code architecture, Jetpack Compose on Android, Ktor server (routing, JWT auth, Exposed, WebSockets), and type-safe DSL design.

## Skills

### `kotlin-specialist`

Senior Kotlin developer covering coroutines, KMP, modern Kotlin 1.9+ patterns, and the broader Kotlin server/Android/multiplatform ecosystem.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Invoke** | Skill reference |
| **Trigger** | Building or reviewing Kotlin code that uses coroutines, Flow, suspend functions, multiplatform expect/actual, Compose composables, Ktor server routing, sealed-class state modeling, scope functions, or DSL builders |

**Workflow:**
1. Analyze architecture (platform targets, coroutine patterns, shared-code strategy)
2. Design models (sealed classes, data classes, type hierarchies)
3. Implement idiomatic Kotlin (coroutines, Flow, extension functions)
4. Validate with `detekt` and `ktlint`; verify coroutine cancellation
5. Optimize (inline classes, sequence operations, compilation strategies)
6. Test with `runTest` and Turbine
