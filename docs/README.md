## Quick Start Recipes

**Review code before shipping (full multi-reviewer pipeline):**
```
/senior-review:team-review
```

**Quick review of specific changes:**
```
/code-review              # auto-detect scope
```

**Optimize React performance:**
```
/review-react src/
```

**Map an unfamiliar codebase:**
```
/map-codebase ../other-project
```

The four relocated multi-agent pipeline commands are documented in their host plugin docs: `/senior-review:team-review` in [senior-review](plugins/senior-review.md), `/codebase-xray:team-analyze` in [codebase-xray](plugins/codebase-xray.md), `/codebase-mapper:team-codebase-map` in [codebase-mapper](plugins/codebase-mapper.md), `/research:team-research` in [research](plugins/research.md). For generic team orchestration (`/agent-teams:team-feature`, `/agent-teams:team-debug`, `/agent-teams:team-spawn` presets), install the upstream `wshobson/agents` plugin.
