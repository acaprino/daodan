# Local service and MCP

## Startup and binding

The declared `codebase-map` server runs over stdio:

```text
uv run --script <installed-plugin-root>/skills/map-method/scripts/mcp_server.py --project <project-root>
```

`uv` provisions the official MCP Python SDK 2.x in its own runtime environment.
The server requires Python 3.11 or later. Existing parser dependencies stay
optional, with the same parser diagnostics and fallback as the CLI. The build
and the reusable `mcp_service.py` module remain standard-library-only.

The project is fixed at startup. Omitting `--project` binds the startup working
directory; a consumer that controls subprocess launch should pass it explicitly.
Every target is relative to that project, and every run ID selects the exact
`.codebase-map/runs/<run-id>/`. Foreign paths, traversal, symlinks and Windows
junctions are rejected. Clients cannot supply an executable, output root or
manifest path. Legacy stores follow the project-bound migration contract;
resolve a reported migration conflict before continuing.

The compiler supplies automatic manifests or host-specific registration notes.
Verify the active host's connection before calling these tools. A shell workflow
uses its existing commands and needs no MCP connection.

## Tools

Every tool returns structured JSON and reports errors as MCP tool failures.

| Tool | Inputs and behavior |
|---|---|
| `codebase_map_scope` | `target="."`: inventory counts, languages and declared exclusions; starts no analysis |
| `codebase_map_create_run` | `target`, exact `run_id`, optional `depth="full"` or `"lite"`, `critical`, `comments`, `docs_only`, `phase`, `stop_after`: snapshot and prepared classic run |
| `codebase_map_runs` | canonical runs and active registry in this project |
| `codebase_map_status` | `run_id`: current `state` and canonical delivery `check`; missing-source diagnostics keep history observable |
| `codebase_map_outline` | `run_id`, optional `path`, `pattern`, `limit=100`: bound symbol metadata |
| `codebase_map_graph` | `run_id`, optional `paths`, `hops=2`, `limit=100`: verified static graph and diagnostics |
| `codebase_map_read` | `run_id`, `requests`: verified source blocks |
| `codebase_map_diff` | `run_id`: read-only source and parser comparison; preserves the snapshot |
| `codebase_map_artifact` | `run_id`, `name`: one declared artifact's content and digest |
| `codebase_map_checkpoint` | `run_id`, `phase`, `event`, optional `message`: persist a host phase hook |
| `codebase_map_events` | `run_id`, optional `after=0`, `limit=100`: persistent events and replay cursor |
| `codebase_map_resume` | `run_id`, optional `phase`: prepare continuation of the unchanged exact run |
| `codebase_map_stop` | `run_id`, `reason`: record partial state and unregister after workers have stopped |
| `codebase_map_publish` | `run_id`: canonical freshness, delivery and whole-mirror publication |

For example, source requests use the source reader's existing selection shape:

```json
{
  "run_id": "src-analysis",
  "requests": [
    {"path": "src/service.py", "symbols": ["Service.validate"]},
    {"path": "src/config.py", "ranges": [{"start": 1, "end": 30}]}
  ]
}
```

`full_file: true` requests the entire inventoried file. Source/parser identity
checks and whole-file fallbacks remain those in `references/evidence.md`.
Outline metadata and emitted source bytes are distinct from a model's actual
deep-reading ledger. Runtime coverage remains none unless supplied by the user.

Creation supports classic full, lite, docs-only and single-phase runs, with the
existing combinations and stop limits. It creates a full new snapshot rather
than carrying incremental claims. `diff` provides change detection; existing CLI
update/carry remains the owner of incremental re-derivation. Reading supports
existing classic and team runs. Native team partitioning still belongs to the
host and the team workflow.

## Host execution and phase hooks

After run preparation, the host resolves scope, dispatches the declared isolated
workers with the exact run and manifest, and follows the canonical method.
The service starts no LLM, does not select models and owns no scheduler.
Creating a run or finishing an MCP call does not complete an analysis.

`status` includes `source_available`. If a target was deleted or renamed, history,
events and stopping remain available, while `check` is null and
`check_unavailable` explains the missing-source condition. `diff` reports the
recorded files and symbols as removed. Verified reads, resume and publication
require the source target. Existing canonical absolute target metadata is
accepted only inside the bound project; client target arguments remain relative.

The host calls `checkpoint` with `phase_started`, `phase_completed` or `blocked`.
A completed checkpoint requires that phase's real declared artifacts and their
applicable delivery checks; it does not certify their semantic conclusions.
Canonical state remains the completion authority. The host verifies requested
human views before publication, because the structural gate cannot establish
that a requested UI artifact was delivered.

To interrupt, first stop the host's workers, then call `stop`. This records a
recoverable partial run; it sends no signal to agents. Resume checks source and
parser freshness and prepares the next work, while the host restarts workers.
Cancelling an MCP request does not cancel an analysis; an in-flight synchronous
mutation may finish and remain visible through `status` and `events`.

## Progress and durable events

Request-scoped progress uses the standard MCP `progressToken` mechanism. Calls
report operation start and successful completion with increasing values and no
invented analysis percentage. These notifications exist only for the active
request, and a caller may ignore them.

Run history is persisted in `mcp-events.json` inside the run. `events` returns
`events`, `next_cursor` and `has_more`. Each event has `cursor`, `timestamp`,
`run_id` and `event`, with phase/message details when applicable. A native UI
stores the last cursor, requests `after` that value, and drains pages while
`has_more` is true. Restarting the server preserves history.

Events record successful service-controlled transitions and explicit host hooks.
Direct CLI or worker writes do not automatically emit events. `status` reads the
canonical files on every request, so clients can reconcile external changes.
There is no filesystem watcher, arbitrary callback URL, notification scheduler
or MCP Tasks requirement. The native app owns polling/subscriptions and display.
Events are derived history; after an interruption, reconcile against state and
delivery checks rather than treating the last notification as proof of success.

## Native consumers

`MapService(project_root)` exposes the same methods as the tool suffixes and
contains no SDK imports. A native backend can call it directly while its agents
use MCP; both share the same run store and checks. Service mutations serialize
through the existing project migration lock, and registry/publication retain
their own canonical lock. Concurrent calls may receive the existing bounded project-lock retry error
while another operation owns that project. Other agent tools remain subject to
their host's permissions and ownership rules.

Tri-Tech Code owns its UI, worker lifetime, Gateway models, routing and app
permissions. This interface retains `.codebase-map/`; it grants no private app
storage binding and supplies no application-specific fork of the analysis.
