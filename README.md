# Daodan

**40 specialized plugins that augment your coding agent into a specialized toolkit - so you spend less time prompting and more time shipping.**

> The Daodan is the symbiote that enhances its host. This marketplace is the Daodan of coding agents: Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Codex and Pi, compiled from one source.

## Why Daodan?

- **Domain experts, not generic prompts** - each plugin encodes months of specialized knowledge (Python, Rust, React, security, SEO, legal...)
- **Multi-agent orchestration** - code review fires architecture, security, and pattern analysis in parallel
- **End-to-end workflows** - chain analysis, implementation, review, and cleanup into single commands
- **Install only what you need** - every plugin is independent, no runtime dependencies
- **Four hosts, one source** - every plugin is compiled into native Claude Code, Copilot, Codex and Pi packages at one identical version
- **Community-driven** - MIT licensed, upstream-synced with projects from Anthropic, Vercel, and others

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add the marketplace (Claude Code; use copilot or codex for those hosts, and see Pi below)
claude plugin marketplace add acaprino/daodan

# Install the plugins you need
claude plugin install python-development@daodan
claude plugin install senior-review@daodan
claude plugin install react-development@daodan
```

The same repository is a native marketplace for Copilot and Codex:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add acaprino/daodan
codex plugin marketplace add acaprino/daodan
```

### Pi

[Pi](https://pi.dev/) has no marketplace: it installs a package, so the repository itself is the
unit, pinned to a released version.

```bash
pi install git:github.com/acaprino/daodan@v28.0.0
```

That gives every plugin at once. To pick a subset, filter in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` rather than
installing selectively, and Pi keeps the choice across updates:

```json
{
  "packages": [{
    "source": "git:github.com/acaprino/daodan",
    "skills": ["exports/pi/plugins/senior-review/**", "exports/pi/plugins/codebase-xray/**"],
    "prompts": ["exports/pi/plugins/senior-review/prompts/*.md"]
  }]
}
```

Two companion packages are worth installing alongside it, because Pi's core deliberately ships
neither mechanism:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-subagents      # every workflow that fans out
pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter    # peer-review only
```

Without `pi-subagents` there is no subagent tool, so a workflow whose contract requires isolated
reviewers stops and says so rather than running its phases in one context and calling the result a
review. Without `pi-mcp-adapter` there is no MCP client, so `/peer-review-review` cannot reach its
challenger transport; every other plugin is unaffected. `pi-subagents` is still pre-1.0, so pin it
if a release breaks something.

Workflows are prefixed with their plugin on this host, because Pi's command namespace is flat and
shared with your own prompts: `/senior-review-code-review`, not `/code-review`. Roles are registered
as skills hidden from the model's skill list, so they cost no context and stay loadable by name.

Coming from the old `claude-code-daodan` marketplace or the VS Code extension? See
[docs/migration-from-claude-code-daodan.md](docs/migration-from-claude-code-daodan.md).

That's it. Plugins activate automatically when relevant - or invoke them directly:

```bash
# Slash commands
/code-review          # Multi-agent architecture + security + pattern review
/senior-review:team-review  # Run a full multi-reviewer code review
/python-scaffold      # Scaffold a production-ready Python project

# Agents
"Use the python-engineer agent to implement rate limiting"
"Ask the rust-engineer to review my Tauri backend"
```

### Required dependencies

`ai-tooling` declares [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) as a hard dependency, marketplace-qualified since v12.0.2 (`dependencies: ["superpowers@claude-plugins-official"]` in `marketplace.json`): its planning phase loads the `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`, and `executing-plans` skills. If you install it, install superpowers too — from the official Claude plugin marketplace, which is the one the dependency resolves against:

```bash
claude plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
```

Installing the same plugin from [obra's own marketplace](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-marketplace) (`superpowers@superpowers-marketplace`) does NOT satisfy the qualified dependency: the CLI reports it as missing and keeps the official copy pinned. Same bytes, wrong marketplace — use the official one, and don't keep both installed (the duplicate collides at load time).

More detail in [Brainstorming, planning, and execution](#brainstorming-planning-and-execution).

`app-analyzer`, `pwa-expert`, `digital-marketing`, and `grabber-development` declare [lackeyjb/playwright-skill](https://github.com/lackeyjb/playwright-skill) as a hard dependency (`dependencies: ["playwright-skill"]`): their browser-based workflows (web app exploration, live PWA audits, live SEO/GA4 checks, scraping discovery) run on its Playwright automation skill. Install it from its own marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add lackeyjb/playwright-skill
claude plugin install playwright-skill@playwright-skill
```

More detail in [Browser automation (Playwright)](#browser-automation-playwright).

`testing` declares two hard dependencies since marketplace 18.0.0: [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (`mattpocock-skills@mattpocock`, the `tdd` knowledge base) and [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) (`developer-essentials@claude-code-workflows`, the `e2e-testing-patterns` knowledge base). Without both installed the plugin does not load at all, so its `/testing:test-audit` and `/testing:test-consolidate` commands silently never appear:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add mattpocock/skills
claude plugin install mattpocock-skills@mattpocock
claude plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
claude plugin install developer-essentials@claude-code-workflows
```

### Dependency graph

Every arrow is a hard dependency (`dependencies` in `marketplace.json`: the plugin does not work without it). There are no optional edges: since marketplace 21.3.0 a dependency on a plugin inside this marketplace is always mandatory, so nothing installs half-working. Plugins with no declared dependencies and no dependents are omitted. External upstream plugins are grouped at the bottom with their marketplace name.

```

Every arrow is a hard dependency. As of marketplace 21.3.0 there are no optional edges at all: a dependency on a plugin inside this marketplace is always mandatory, so installing one plugin installs everything it needs and no capability can silently go missing. The graph is rooted at `codebase-xray`, the plugin that works out how a codebase actually behaves: `senior-review` (review), `codebase-mapper` (documentation), and `abstraction-architect` all build on top of it, and it depends on nothing of ours. That shape is deliberate as of marketplace 16.0.0, when the shared interconnect mapper moved into `codebase-xray` and removed the last near-cycle. `senior-review`'s six edges back its review dimensions, each run or skipped on whether the change shows its signal, never on whether a plugin is present. `text-humanizer` is a pure leaf: zero dependencies, four dependents. `frontend-review` sits outside that tree: its three external arrows are hard dependencies on design plugins from other marketplaces, which the user installs by hand, so it does not join the `codebase-xray` root; its four local arrows back the auto-detected code dimensions. `research` depends on nothing at all, deliberately: it researches the web and nothing else. `peer-review` sits outside the tree the same way `ai-tooling` does: its one arrow is a hard dependency on external `superpowers`, and nothing of ours depends on it.

### Frontend and design

Design content stays upstream: three external plugins cover design craft, design-system deliverables, and visual craft, and this marketplace does not vendor any of it. What lives here instead is [frontend-review](docs/plugins/frontend-review.md), a pure orchestrator that drives those three upstream skills alongside the local code reviewers in one scored pass:

| Upstream | License | Covers |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [pbakaus/impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable) | Apache-2.0 | Design craft: typography, color and contrast, motion, cognitive load, delight, iOS/Android platform patterns |
| [nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill](https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill) | MIT | Design-system deliverables: token architecture, component specs, states and variants, Tailwind integration |
| [frontend-design](https://claude.com/plugins/frontend-design) (official marketplace) | Apache-2.0 | Visual craft: applied by `frontend-review` as evaluation criteria for existing UI, not as a generator |
| [paulirish/dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/tree/main/agents/skills/modern-css) | MIT | Modern CSS reference. Not a marketplace: copy the skill folder by hand |

Install all three marketplace-backed sources:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add pbakaus/impeccable
claude plugin install impeccable@impeccable
claude plugin marketplace add nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill
claude plugin install ui-ux-pro-max@ui-ux-pro-max-skill
claude plugin install frontend-design@claude-plugins-official
```

Framework-specific frontend work stays here: [frontend-review](docs/plugins/frontend-review.md) as the combined design-plus-code entry point, [react-development](docs/plugins/react-development.md) for React 19 performance, [pwa-expert](docs/plugins/pwa-expert.md) for Progressive Web Apps, [browser-extensions](docs/plugins/browser-extensions.md) for Firefox add-ons, and [xterm](docs/plugins/xterm.md) for terminal UIs.

### Brainstorming, planning, and execution

Same story for the design-first workflow. The `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`, and `executing-plans` skills shipped in `ai-tooling` were ports of [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), which maintains them upstream inside a much larger methodology. Carrying three stale copies stopped paying for itself, so they are gone as of ai-tooling 3.0.0. As of marketplace 8.2.0, superpowers is no longer an optional companion: `ai-tooling` declares it as a hard dependency in `marketplace.json` — qualified as `superpowers@claude-plugins-official` since v12.0.2 — so install it from there alongside this marketplace.

| Upstream | License | Covers |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | MIT | Design-first development: brainstorming a spec you actually sign off on, bite-sized implementation plans, subagent-driven execution, TDD, systematic debugging, worktree workflows |

Superpowers is listed on the [official Claude plugin marketplace](https://claude.com/plugins/superpowers), and the qualified dependency only resolves against that copy:

```bash
claude plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
```

Obra's own [Superpowers marketplace](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-marketplace) carries the same plugin plus a few companions (e.g. `double-shot-latte`); adding that marketplace for the companions is fine, but install superpowers itself from `claude-plugins-official` only — a second copy from another marketplace doesn't satisfy the dependency and collides at load time.

Upstream also documents installs for Antigravity, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Kimi, OpenCode, and Pi: see its [installation section](https://github.com/obra/superpowers#installation).

**Must-have from that toolkit:** the [`using-git-worktrees`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/tree/main/skills/using-git-worktrees) skill ([overview on SkillsMP](https://skillsmp.com/creators/obra/superpowers/skills-using-git-worktrees)). Before feature work or plan execution it checks whether the session is already isolated, creates an isolated workspace (native tools first, plain `git worktree` as fallback), runs project setup, and verifies a clean test baseline. As of marketplace 13.0.0 it also replaces the retired local `git-worktrees` plugin (see [Git worktrees](#git-worktrees-parallel-development)).

Everything downstream of the plan stays here: [senior-review](docs/plugins/senior-review.md) for multi-agent review, [codebase-xray](docs/plugins/codebase-xray.md) for partitioned X-ray analysis, [codebase-mapper](docs/plugins/codebase-mapper.md) for codebase mapping, [research](docs/plugins/research.md) for multi-source research, [testing](docs/plugins/testing.md) for test-suite hygiene and test generation, and the per-language plugins for domain execution. Parallel feature implementation and other generic team workflows are delegated to the upstream `wshobson/agents` `agent-teams` plugin (see below). Where a workflow used to invoke the removed skills, it now loads the superpowers skills directly and expects them to be installed: superpowers remains a declared hard dependency of `ai-tooling`.

### Agent teams (parallel implementation and generic orchestration)

As of marketplace 9.0.0, the generic core of the old local `agent-teams` plugin (parallel feature implementation, competing-hypotheses debugging, and the generic `team-spawn` presets) is delegated to its upstream, since maintaining a fork of general-purpose team orchestration stopped paying for itself:

| Upstream | License | Covers |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) | MIT | Generic multi-agent orchestration: `/agent-teams:team-feature`, `/agent-teams:team-debug`, `/agent-teams:team-spawn` presets |

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
claude plugin install agent-teams@claude-code-workflows
```

The three pipelines this marketplace built on top of the old `agent-teams` plugin were relocated rather than removed (the fourth, `/research:team-research`, dropped the dependency in marketplace 25.0.0 and runs on plain subagents). Their commands live locally, but each of the three plugins declares `agent-teams@claude-code-workflows` as a hard dependency in `marketplace.json` (the pipelines load its skills and spawn its `team-reviewer` fallback agent), so the upstream install above is required:

- `/agent-teams:team-review` -> [`/senior-review:team-review`](docs/plugins/senior-review.md)
- `/agent-teams:team-deep-dive` -> [`/codebase-xray:team-analyze`](docs/plugins/codebase-xray.md)
- `/agent-teams:team-codebase-map` -> [`/codebase-mapper:team-codebase-map`](docs/plugins/codebase-mapper.md)
- `/agent-teams:team-research` -> [`/research:team-research`](docs/plugins/research.md) (no longer needs agent-teams)

### Browser automation (Playwright)

As of marketplace 11.0.0, the `playwright-skill` plugin is no longer vendored here. The local copy was byte-identical to its upstream (which installs directly as a marketplace), so it was handed back:

| Upstream | License | Covers |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [lackeyjb/playwright-skill](https://github.com/lackeyjb/playwright-skill) | MIT | General-purpose browser automation with Playwright: auto-detects dev servers, writes and runs test scripts, screenshots, responsive checks, login flows, link checking |

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add lackeyjb/playwright-skill
claude plugin install playwright-skill@playwright-skill
```

The plugins that build on it ([app-analyzer](docs/plugins/app-analyzer.md), [pwa-expert](docs/plugins/pwa-expert.md), [digital-marketing](docs/plugins/digital-marketing.md), [grabber-development](docs/plugins/grabber-development.md)) declare it as a hard dependency and keep referencing the same `playwright-skill:playwright-skill` namespace, which resolves as written once the upstream plugin is installed.

### Reverse engineering (binary analysis)

As of marketplace 12.0.0, the `reverse-engineering` plugin is no longer vendored here. The local copy was byte-identical to its upstream, which already publishes the same plugin in the `claude-code-workflows` marketplace, so it was handed back:

| Upstream | License | Covers |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) | MIT | Binary reverse engineering, malware analysis, firmware security, and protocol research: `reverse-engineer`, `malware-analyst`, and `firmware-analyst` agents plus four reference skills (binary-analysis-patterns, anti-reversing-techniques, memory-forensics, protocol-reverse-engineering) |

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
claude plugin install reverse-engineering@claude-code-workflows
```

No plugin in this marketplace depends on it, so nothing else here changes when it is absent: install it from upstream only if you need the reverse-engineering toolkit itself.

### Git worktrees (parallel development)

As of marketplace 13.0.0, the `git-worktrees` plugin (1 agent, 1 skill, the `/wt` command) is retired. Unlike the other delegated areas it was locally authored rather than vendored, but the same economics applied: superpowers' `using-git-worktrees` skill covers the high-value part of the workflow (isolated workspace setup before feature work or plan execution, with project setup and clean-baseline verification), and superpowers is already a required install here.

| Upstream | License | Covers |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | MIT | `using-git-worktrees` ([overview on SkillsMP](https://skillsmp.com/creators/obra/superpowers/skills-using-git-worktrees)): workspace isolation via native tools first, plain `git worktree` as fallback, then project setup and clean test baseline |

Install instructions are in [Required dependencies](#required-dependencies); no extra marketplace is needed. The `/wt` lifecycle extras (pause/resume with session context, guided merge flow) retire without replacement: plain `git worktree` commands cover those cases. No plugin in this marketplace depended on `git-worktrees`, so nothing else changes.

### Prompt improver (hook)

As of marketplace 17.0.0, the `prompt-improver` plugin (1 skill, 4 hook handlers) is no longer vendored here. It was a JS re-port of its upstream's `UserPromptSubmit` nudge engine; the upstream installs directly and evolves faster than the port could track it:

| Upstream | License | Covers |

| [severity1/claude-code-prompt-improver](https://github.com/severity1/claude-code-prompt-improver) | MIT | Prompt clarity evaluation before execution, research-based clarifying questions, and the declarative nudge engine that replaced the original scripts |

No plugin in this marketplace depended on `prompt-improver`, so nothing else changes.

### Test authoring knowledge bases (TDD and browser E2E)

As of marketplace 18.0.0, the `testing` plugin no longer vendors its two knowledge-base skills. Both upstreams install directly, so the copies were handed back and `testing` declares them as hard dependencies in `marketplace.json`:

| Upstream | License | Covers |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) | MIT | `mattpocock-skills:tdd`: language-agnostic TDD methodology (red-to-green workflow, behavior-first tests, mocking discipline) plus companion engineering skills |
| [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) | MIT | `developer-essentials:e2e-testing-patterns`: Playwright/Cypress E2E patterns (page objects, fixtures, waiting strategies, network mocking, visual regression) plus companion developer skills |

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add mattpocock/skills
claude plugin install mattpocock-skills@mattpocock
claude plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
claude plugin install developer-essentials@claude-code-workflows
```

References across this marketplace use the upstream namespaces (`mattpocock-skills:tdd`, `developer-essentials:e2e-testing-patterns`), which resolve as written once the upstream plugins are installed. Both upstreams are multi-skill bundles, so the install brings their companion skills along.

### Codebase cleanup command trio (deps-audit, refactor-clean, tech-debt)

As of marketplace 19.0.0, the `codebase-cleanup` plugin (3 commands cherry-picked from `wshobson/agents`) is retired. Unlike the delegated areas above it was deleted rather than handed back: a line-by-line review verified content defects worth not recommending even by delegation (an `npm audit fix --force` auto-remediation script, a binary license-compatibility matrix, absolute code metrics presented as pass/fail gates, fabricated ROI figures), and delegating would also have pulled in the two upstream agents originally excluded for overlap with senior-review and testing. The capability lives on locally, split by concern:

- Structural refactoring: [clean-code](docs/plugins/clean-code.md) and [python-development](docs/plugins/python-development.md)'s `/python-refactor`
- Tech-debt inventory: [senior-review](docs/plugins/senior-review.md)'s `cleanup-auditor` dimension (extended with lifecycle archaeology in the same release). Workspace hygiene, meaning everything the filesystem and git decide without reading a symbol: [repo-hygiene](docs/plugins/repo-hygiene.md)'s `/tidy` and `code-auditor`
- Dependency auditing (CVE, licenses, supply chain, outdated packages): the new hand-authored [dependency-audit](docs/plugins/dependency-audit.md) plugin and its `/dependency-audit:deps-audit` command

Users who want the original trio can install it from upstream:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
claude plugin install codebase-cleanup@claude-code-workflows
```

<summary><b>How Plugins Work</b></summary>

| Type | What it is | How to use |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Agent** | A specialized AI persona with domain expertise | `Use the python-engineer agent to implement rate limiting` |
| **Skill** | A knowledge module Claude references automatically | Activates when the task matches its trigger keywords |
| **Command** | A slash command that kicks off a workflow | `/code-review`, `/python-scaffold`, `/senior-review:team-review` |

Plugin content is pure Markdown with optional Python helper scripts, plus a declarative TOML control plane per plugin. A stdlib-only compiler turns those kernels into native packages for all four hosts, so nothing under `exports/` is written by hand. A consistency CI guards the contracts on every push: cross-plugin references must match declared dependencies, plugin changes must bump versions, and every committed package must reproduce byte-for-byte from its source.

<summary><b>Recommended Settings (skill visibility)</b></summary>

With 40 plugins installed, Claude Code's default skill-listing budget can truncate the list of available skills shown at conversation start. Raise the fraction of context allocated to the skill listing in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "skillListingBudgetFraction": 0.15
}
```

Guideline values:

- `0.15` - moderate bump, recommended starting point
- `0.25` - high, useful if you keep most plugins enabled
- `0.40` - maximum visibility, reduces tokens available to the conversation

Restart Claude Code (or open a new session) after editing.
